Rene Golder  0:52  
Hi, good morning.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  0:53  
Hey, good morning. Thank you so much for helping do this interview. Really appreciate it.

Rene Golder  0:57  
Thanks for having me.

# CAREER JOURNEY

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  0:58  
Yes. You're very welcome. Renee. Do you mind briefly describing your career journey for us? 

Rene Golder  1:03  
Wow. Okay. Yes. So, you know, I grew up in Santa Cruz. I went to Bonnie doon Elementary and then Mission Hill, Santa Cruz High and I was not super interested in academics, you could say I was young for my grade. And so I didn't have the best grades in high school. I knew that I wanted to go to college, but no one in my family had gone to college before me. And so my mom's advice was always just talk to the counselors and so the counselors every semester, I would meet with them and they advised me to go to Cabrillo. And then at Cabrillo they helped me finish Cabrillo and four semesters. And I was always  really interested in traveling. And so I did a couple of trips abroad whilst being a student at Cabrillo during vacations and breaks. I wouldn't say I was super mature. I graduated high school when I was 17. 

And so once I was ready to transfer, I was still only 19 years old. And so I ended up at UCSC. And I had no idea what I wanted to be. At Cabrillo I had a history class that I really liked. So I decided to major in history. And while I was at UCSC, it was funny because my mom was a bus driver up there. And so she had a parking pass because she would bike to work. And so I was parked in like the staff parking and so I never really made any friends while I was at UCSC. I just still kept my same friends from home from town. And so I just studied history, and I had two really great professors that I liked up there. And then I still didn't have a clue what I wanted to be. So when I graduated UCSC, my boyfriend at the time and I, This was the year 2000. We sold everything that we had, and we put some stuff up in a shed and Bonnie Doon that we wanted to keep. We sold our cars. And we bought a circle Pacific ticket and we traveled the South Pacific for a year. 

And then when I got back, I was working a little bit at Pacific Wave just to make money and we moved back in with my parents and my dad was like, "You need to get out, this is terrible". And so I was like "shoot, I probably should start like figuring out a way to make a little more money". And while I was working at Pacific Wave, I ran into somebody that I knew who had just got a job substituting and he said that "the county is super desperate for substitutes". And in fact, at his school at SLV, there was a person going out on maternity leave that was a history teacher and asked if I was maybe interested in taking a long term sub position at San Fernando Valley High School. And like I said I was young. I'm also super short. I'm not even five feet tall. And they asked and so they like snatched me up, I think because they were desperate. And so I started substituting in this high school class for juniors and seniors. It was a history class or a history teacher's class for the entire spring semester. And I really like apologize to those kids, if any of them are listening today. They're adults now but wow, I was terrible. 

Like it was horrible. At one point one of the kids actually asked to go the bathroom in stole my keys and joyrided my car outisde. And the principal called me and said, "Please don't let your car to students" and I said "Not only would I not lend the car to students, I don't let my boyfriend drive. It's my first brand new car. Like what?" And so at the end of the year, there was three of us that were on emergency credentials, and they were so desperate, they were willing to like keep us on and let us do this internship program. And two of them stayed on and I think still work up there. I was like, "No, I am the worst. Like there's no way I could do this. I'll be eaten alive." So I actually went back to school. I did however, like teaching, I just knew it wasn't the right fit. And so I went back to school and I went to CSUMB and got my credential that year. And it was a one year program and then as soon as I graduated, I went in the exact opposite direction. I went down to South County. I got a job teaching kindergarten, bilingual kindergarten in Pajaro and I taught there for five years. That's the exact opposite of high school. So that's kind of how I ended up as a teacher.

That is a really cool and an interesting story. Thank you so much for sharing. And going back to it. What did you call the tickets that you and your boyfriend bought? 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  5:20  
It was called a Circle Pacific ticket and they still sell it but yeah, you can buy a round the world ticket or a circle Pacific ticket. They're two different ones. And at the time it was $1,800. I think each. Then yeah, we just budgeted like 1000 bucks for each country and however long it lasted. That's how long we stayed.

Oh, that sounds like such a cool experience. And also you mentioned so when you started teaching at SLV, did you mention that you had an emergency credential? How does that work? 

Rene Golder  5:47  
I did. And right now, if anyone out there is listening and has a bachelor's degree and is thinking about going into teaching, again, we're at a time where we are desperate for teachers. And so anyone with a bachelor's degree can take a test called the CBest through the state. And then they can register with the county. And I think the county right now, because we're so desperate for substitute teachers, is actually paying for the CBest and paying for the licensing stuff so that you can you can substitute and then you're authorized to substitute K-12 throughout the county. And so anyone that's thinking about teaching and has a bachelor's already, that's a great way to try and see. You're interested, but maybe some things are a better fit than something else. Like for me, clearly High School is not a good fit Right? But I knew that I wanted to teach after that experience and I found the right fit in elementary school.

Yeah, that's really great. And did they offer like a kind of a crash course before you took that test?

No, though, there's books and things you can buy. And I just read the book. It's basically everything you learned from kindergarten through 12th grade. Sorry, state, it's not that hard. It's a pretty easy test. If you just read the little book, and you can pass it. 

# SANTA CRUZ COUNCILWOMAN

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  7:01  
Okay. Thanks, Rene. So how did you become a Santa Cruz city councilwoman.

Rene Golder  7:04  
So that is another kind of random journey. But I had taught in Pajaro for about five years. And then I had a couple of kids, and they were in daycare and my husband got a new job over in San Jose. And he couldn't take the kids to daycare anymore. So it was kind of like a transportation issue, or I probably would have stayed working in South County, but because of the time of childcare didn't work. I wanted to get a job closer to home. And so I started looking at Santa Cruz city schools, and ended up at Bayview. And while working at Bayview, I taught fifth grade here. And there was a parent in my class who ran the citizens police academy and he knew that I was always interested in law enforcement and that kind of stuff. And I was always impressed by the work that SCPD did. And so I did this citizens Police Academy. I also have a couple of friends that have been on the previous councils. And at one point, and I think it was like 2012 2013. I remember there was a terrible tragedy in the community with two officers that got shot.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  7:04  
 I remember that, over by Whole foods. 

Rene Golder  7:15  
Exactly, yeah. And so a friend, Hilary Bryant, she was mayor at the time, and Lynn Robinson was on the council as well. And they wanted to put together a group of citizens, the public safety task force to help advise the council with a series of recommendations after studying some of the issues around public safety for close to a year. So they brought together like a diverse community group, and they wanted me to represent kind of education and youth in our community. And so I was asked to serve on that advisory body and I did. And I was really, interested in helping Santa Cruz in like a larger capacity at that point. But at that time, my kids were still young, and I had thought about running for counsel then and it was actually Hillary and Lynn that advised me not to they said "It's really hard on the kids and hard on your family." And they said if they if they they were me, they would wait until my kids were a little bit older. And some of the rationale was that people say really nasty things about you and and it can affect the kids and so I really I respect them took parental heart and so I wanted to wait.

 And so I was planning on running in a regular election. The last one that just happened. I don't know what year it was . 2020 I guess. But prior to that, there was the Recall Initiative that was moving forward. And there was nobody really stepping into run as an alternative if the recall passed, and I wasn't really thinking that the recall would pass, but they just kind of needed somebody, in case it did. And so I was like, "Well, I may as well run now. And I can get my campaign committee organized. I can get my banking stuff in order and then I'll be set to go for the fall. And so that's kind of what I thought was gonna happen. And in fact, the recall, went through, and I won. And so there I was. I wasn't really expecting it. And even after the election, I didn't think I was going to win. And it wasn't until like, three weeks after the election when the votes were certified that I even believed that I didn't track the election daily or anything like that. Like I just was like "Well, I was working".  I have a full time job. So that's where I ended up there. So it was sooner than I thought. But here I am.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  10:56  
Awesome. Well, congratulations on becoming a Santa Cruz city councilwoman and like  what's expected of you?

Rene Golder  11:03  
So we have our meetings, a couple times a month .They are very long, sometimes up to like 16 hours. It's kind of grueling. So prior to the meeting, we're expected to read our agenda packet, which gets published on Thursday. And sometimes it's 16 17 hundred pages. Their lengthy.  Were expected to read that and we meet with the city manager, we follow up with the city manager or department heads, if we have any questions prior to the meeting. It's kind of like , doing your homework and your due diligence. In addition, you get correspondence from community members. Whether they're emails or meetings or whatever they are in regards to the issues that are on the current agenda or maybe issues that are just popping up around town that they want to discuss, things that are bothering them. And in a way, I kind of feel like a yard duty for the whole city. "Stop reporting it to me". Some things tattling, some things are important. And just kind of filtering what to do and how to help. Sometimes it's just helping people navigate where they need to address their concern or their issue. And then there's like, committee work outside of that, too. We're so reserved on several boards and committees, in addition that we report back to the Council on 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  12:10  
Okay, so it sounds like you're pretty busy. And also like with everything kind of going on the past two years, when you became a city councilman, I would imagine a busy time.

Rene Golder  12:20  
I would definitely describe myself as busy. Yeah.

# TYPICAL DAY

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  12:23  
I mean, not to mention being a principal at Bayview Elementary. That's definitely like a full time job. You want to talk kind of about what your typical day or work looks like? And has that changed over the past two years? I think you told me before the interview that you're at school every day, even when it was on lockdown. 

Rene Golder  12:41  
Yeah, so how it's changed I think since the pandemic is I feel like I've gotten lazy or actually because I used to wake up at five religiously and go work out  whether it's running or Pilates or  something like that. Now, I feel like I'm a little slacker-ish. So, I try most days to wake up and do a workout before work. But sometimes I don't, I have to admit. And so I try to get to work by like 7:30. And then I'm here at school, until usually 3:30 to five most days. And throughout the day while I'm here, I'm in meetings, I'm in classrooms, I'm out on the playground, I'm talking to parents. I'm coordinating things that need to be done with the district office and that's kind of what it's like to be a principal. It's a little bit different than being in the classroom. And then after work, if I have any city council business, I take care of that, like meetings or things like that. If I don't, then I am just like most people, I go home and I check in with my kids. Luckily my kids are getting a little older so my son drives himself where he needs to go and my daughter sometimes bikes but just like most parents, I have to do carpool sometimes for different activities. And then I love eating at home. And so I make dinner probably four nights a week or maybe more and do family dinner. I'm really close with my sister and her husband and their kids. And actually one of them's a fifth grader here at Bayview. So we have dinner together three or four nights a week if possible. And then after dinner, I find myself checking emails responding to emails, and then it's just shower and bed. I'm in bed pretty early though. I'm a total bed troll.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  14:42  
Your days are pretty busy. So I think that's understandable.

Rene Golder  14:46  
8:30 or 9:00 I'm like "Good Night!"

# PRINCIPAL AT BAYVIEW

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  14:49  
And how long have you been the principal at Bayview?

Rene Golder  14:52  
This is my first year being principal. For the last four years, I was the RTI coordinator so I was out of the  classroom. And it's similar to like what an assistant principal does in other districts. We don't have assistant principals here in Santa Cruz. But you're out of the classroom, you do academic intervention and assessment. In this role, some of the big differences are I'm doing employee evaluations and creating the school plan. But other than that I feel like my job as the RTI coordinator's pretty close to what I'm doing now. 

# DISTANCE LEARNING CHALLENGES

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  15:27  
It must have been pretty tough on that age for the students being away from school and trying to distance learn?

Rene Golder  15:34  
I think, for some kids, it was, it was really difficult for sure. I'm pretty optimistic, though. I tried to see the good in what happened. And I feel like it was good for families to have time to connect with each other in ways that they hadn't before. I also felt like for families that didn't have access to technology, it was an opportunity for them to kind of close that digital gap that exists in our society. The other thing that I thought was good that came out of it was that oftentimes, I'd be working with students or see students online, and their parents would be sitting right beside them. And for some parents in our community, that maybe don't speak English fluently or don't have the education that others have had an opportunity to receive, it was a way for them to see that teaching their child reading and writing and math isn't magic and it's not something that they can't be part of. So like, for example, a parent could see that we were with a group of first graders doing rhyming that can be really done in any language, and it's something that parents can do to help their student be successful. And so, although it wasn't ideal, and I'm sure there's lots of negative impacts, I tried to look at the bright spots.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  17:03  
 Oh absolutely, I don't think it serves anyone too well to dwell on all the negatives, but to look at the silver linings, and to have the perspective that you try your best to have. I think that's great.

Rene Golder  17:15  
And I'm so glad that kids are back! I am so glad they're here.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  17:19  
Yeah. And I'm sure they're glad to be back, too. That's awesome. 

Rene Golder  17:22  
Yeah.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  17:24  
Going back to your city council woman position. How long are those terms?

Rene Golder  17:30  
They're four year terms

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  17:31  
They're four year terms? Cool. Your're in your second year you said right?.

Rene Golder  17:36  
Yeah. And actually because I took over for that recall position, my terms up in December 2022. And then we are currently in the process of switching to district elections. And so I don't know what that will mean for me. There's three current city council members sitting in the same neighborhood. Shebreh Kalantari-Johnson, Donna Meyers, and I all live within a few blocks of each other. And Shebreh was the last elected so technically if we keep moving forward with the path that it appears we're on. When I get turned out in December, and Donna gets turned out in December next year, we won't be able to run because Shebreh will be in the seat for our neighborhood. And quite honestly, at this point today, I'm fine with that. Like, I'm totally fine with that. I'm really busy. I wouldn't mind not having a second job.

# REFLECTION ON BOTH ROLES

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  18:29  
 Yeah, I could totally understand. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the What To Be Show on KSQD, Santa Cruz, 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Harte. And I'm speaking with Renee Golder, who is the principal of Bayview Elementary as well as a Santa Cruz City  Councilwoman. Rene, do you mind telling us some of the environments that you work in with either of your jobs being a city council woman or being the principal? Are you out and about? Are you primarily working from the desk? Or what's that look like?

Rene Golder  19:00  
Well, I'm pretty sure I have adult ADHD. So at any point, it's really rare to see me sitting in a desk. Actually, I don't even have a desk in my office at school. There's a table and there's a there's like a standing cart thing that I'll use when I'm working on my computer but I prefer to be out and about at any anytime during the day. When I'm forced to sit, I do. But during the day I like to be out and about walking around through the campus.  For city council unfortunately, it's a 180 degree opposite because the majority of my city council responsibilities are responding to emails or sitting in meetings. And so that's that's actually a challenge for me.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  19:45  
Well, at least you have the contrast between the two. 

Rene Golder  19:51  
Yeah.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  19:51  
Yeah. And do you want to talk about what kind of skills you use in both your jobs and did you acquire the skills through working the jobs or maybe some school stuff probably helped you out too? 

Rene Golder  19:51  
That's a great question! 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  20:06  
Or maybe it's just part of your personality,  interacting with people

Rene Golder  20:10  
It might be part of my personality. I am pretty outgoing in my personality. Also, some of my friends think I was born with a part of my brain missing that gets scared of things. And so, where some people would get scared or worried about things. I don't. I just try to solve the problem. I don't know how to describe it. That's kind of where I think that that is where I might be a little different than some other teachers that I work with. The other thing, as far as skills that one could develop, I think, being a good listener, and just listening to people without judgment, and trying to maybe they don't want their problem solved, maybe they just want to be heard, is something that's important in both of my roles, I think, yeah,

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  21:15  
Yeah. Do you want to talk about what kind of person do you think would enjoy being in either a city councilwoman or a principal of an elementary school?

Rene Golder  21:24  
It's funny, because I think of myself more as a teacher than a principal, but I think of myself as like a "Lead Teacher". I would think that someone that would want to go into education, whether it's administration or being a teacher would be somebody that appreciates having every day be a little bit different but yet the same. So you have your routine, right? You know, when your days off are gonna be. It's kind of a set schedule in that regard. But every day is gonna be a little bit different. And there's something weird that's going to happen and so there's always something to laugh about at dinner that happened at school. And so it's like  every day, I'm excited to go to work at school. I love my job at school. For city council, it's a little bit different, I think that it's for people that obviously are trying to make Santa Cruz the best place it can be and not everybody sees eye to eye on the way to get there. And so, you have to be able to be flexible, and willing to compromise and that can be frustrating at times. The other thing I think, in both worlds is things in government move at a glacial pace, and that can be frustrating for some people. And so that's something that's frustrating for me. And so sometimes I have to temper it down, because I want to move things along a lot faster.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  22:59  
Yeah, especially if like if you're passionate about something and you see the urgency for something to get done but it's not on your time that you have to be as part of a process right? 

Rene Golder  23:08  
Exactly.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  23:09  
 Do you want to share why your job is important to you or to society?

Rene Golder  23:16  
Sure ,so obviously democracy is the foundation of our country and education is the foundation of our democracy. And so for me, I'm such a proletariat, I'm a full believer in not only school, but public school, and not only public school, but your local neighborhood school. And so my belief is that, if nothing else, like it's our responsibility as educators to get every kid to the highest place they want to get to. Right? And so like, it's our obligation to show them the opportunities in front of them and to hold high standards to expect and demand that they can achieve that and not make excuses for them. And then, for obvious reasons, I think Council is important just as a local oversight and governing body for our city and just being the voice of the people. But even on council, every decision I make on council, I think about the 7000 children in town that don't get to vote because from my perspective, any adult in Santa Cruz, they live here by choice, whether they're homeless, whether they have lived here their whole life. They're living in Santa Cruz by choice but every single child has zero choice in where they live. And so that's why even they're not voting for me, they didn't donate to my campaign, who I'm serving on council is the kids because what matters to them like matters to me. And that's that's kind of it. 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  25:05  
Well, I think that's a really great perspective and did you find anything surprising about your job when you started? Either job

Rene Golder  25:12  
I would say more with counsel, I found it more surprising, I found it more surprising how devious some people are and how it's really frustrating to me. The dirty tactics that some people use in this town is really appalling. And disgusting.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  25:31  
Yeah, that's unfortunate. And do you think that people have a misconception about what you do?

Rene Golder  25:37  
I think they have a misconception about the power that we have. No, they think I'm a wizard, or something. That we can do that. We really don't have that much power.  We can't change everything. You know, there's some things we have better in our sphere of influence and certainly, my colleagues and I are working to achieve that. But some things are just not in our job description or power.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  26:00  
Yeah, for sure. Do you want to share maybe the most memorable part of your career so far?

Rene Golder  26:06  
The most memorable part of my career? Oh, wow. Okay. I can't think of a single incident. But I think for me, after I've been here at Bayview now over 15 16 years. And so just like, the traditions and the people that have come through are the most memorable part for me.  Seeing kids that I've known from kindergarten coming back to work at Bayview and go on to lead successful lives of their own. Just the annual traditions with the carnival and the Halloween parade and the Fiesta De Las Artes and just all of the stuff that we do every year is just the most memorable things for me I that I enjoy, and I love and I look forward to every year. 

# ADVICE TO LISTENERS

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  27:01  
Yeah, that's really nice. And, Renee, what advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career in either education or getting involved in local politics like you as a city council person.

Rene Golder  27:14  
So for younger kids,  middle school, high school kids, I advise them to study what interests them. Because if you study what interests you, that's what's gonna get you motivated to get through college. If you're studying something, because you think it's going to have the job that you want? I don't know anybody that started in college, and then finished college and went on to the job that they want or thought that they were going to have. I feel like everyone's career path is a winding road, right? And so my advice is study what interests you because that is where you're gonna find a job that you love to do every day. And that's what life's about. Your life is short. And if you don't love your job, then why do it?  Quit, find something else. Because that's what life's about. You spend more time at work at home

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  28:01  
Yeah, that's true. And like you, you took a history class at Cabrillo. Right? And you went on to UCSC. And you didn't know that that was maybe going to be your career path. But I would imagine that the education that you received at both those institutions served you well for what you're doing now, right?

Rene Golder  28:18  
Not only that, it was like I think the reason I went into education is I actually really liked my teachers. I had a teacher, Professor Gary Miles, and another professor Cindy Polecritti up at UCSC. And it was more that I liked their teaching style and my relationship with them that inspired me to go into teaching. I love the history too but that's what kind of inspired me to go that way.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  28:18  
Yeah, that is really cool. Rene, I just wanted to thank you so much for taking the time. I know how busy you are to help us do this interview today. Really appreciate it. And you shared some really good advice and shared some great resources. And again, I apreciate you being involved and being a guest on the show today. 

Rene Golder  28:55  
Yeah, thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate that
