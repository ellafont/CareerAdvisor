I'm Patrick Hart and you're listening to our show, What to Be, where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What to Be is a program provided by Your Future is Our Business, a Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers. Through programs such as college and career expo's panels and other work based learning activities. Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of natural bridge's media, or your future as our business. The information provided during this program does not reflect its career in its entirety. And today I have the pleasure to welcome to the show, Chris Leone, who's the owner of Leone electric and instructor of ABC NorCal. Hi, Chris. Christine Leone: Hi, Patrick. Patrick Hart: Thank you so much for being a guest on the show this evening. I really appreciate you taking your time to help us out.Christine Leone: My pleasure. # EARLY CAREER [00:01:21] Patrick Hart: That's awesome. Thank you. And Chris, would you please describe your career journey for us? [00:01:28] Christine Leone: Well, when I was in high school and that was a long time ago, and we were taking SATs. Mine said that I was supposed to be a mechanic. Well, in 1968, that was, that was an interesting career path to think about, to ponder.But, lo and behold, in the end, I ended up being an electrician, which is a very mechanical, actually, believe it or not, it's a mechanical trade as well. So, in 1974, I had the opportunity to become an industrial mechanic for, John Ingalls frozen foods is where I started. And then from there I went to, let's see, where did I go there? Harmony Foods. I was an industrial mechanic for several years and at some point I was asked to become manager of the maintenance department. Which kind of put my electrical career on hold, but I thought it was a good opportunity to learn how to manage projects. I went from there back into residential.So I worked for a contractor in Santa Cruz in residential for many years. And then after that, back to industrial. And I finally ended up, in 1989 getting my own C10 contractor's license and started my own business. I did that until 2009 when the recession hit me pretty hard, and I thought, wow, I have to find a job, like a J-O-B job.When I came to that realization, I had been thinking about teaching. I had an opportunity to teach at a trade tech school in San Jose, Center for Employment Training, and I taught as an instructor for electricians in training for about nine and a half years. From there, I went to an apprenticeship program, ABC NorCal Associated Builders and Contractors in Livermore, and I've been there just a little over five years.All the while, my contractor's license is still intact, so I still do some work, not much, because most of my focus is on teaching. In fact, 99. 9 percent of it is on teaching now. So I've been a teacher for about 15 years for apprentices.# MENTORS AND MENTORING [00:04:03] Patrick Hart: Well, that's awesome. And I would imagine that feels really good to take everything that you've learned over that long career and kind of help, you know, give back and help teach the new generation of electricians.[00:04:16] Christine Leone: That's exactly right. I had great mentors. I sought out mentors and I've had the opportunity now to become one for many years. And there's one thing that keeps me and has kept me in teaching is. It is the opportunity to see the lightbulb come on in students and them come back to me many years later, Ms. Chris, Ms. Chris, I'm running my own business, or Ms. Chris, I passed my journey level test, or, I mean, it's just, you know, it's so fun and satisfying to see young people, and not always young, I mean, I had older people in my program too, but people move on in their lives and have an opportunity to make really good income.And watch them, you know, buy homes and have children and, you know, travel the world or whatever they do with, with the money that they make, but certainly better themselves financially in life and do something that they love. [00:05:16] Patrick Hart: Yeah, that's great. And, and maybe you even, do you learn from your students sometimes too?[00:05:24] Christine Leone: I tell you, I started, oh, let's see, I was, I started teaching in 2009 and what was I, 20 something? 30 years into my career, I forgot. I can't do the numbers right now, I started in 74. I learned more about my trade, not the hands on part, but all the little details, because in electrical, electrical has a very large umbrella.A lot of things come under it. I learned so much by teaching. So, because when I became a teacher, I had to study, and,  I mean, really study to stay out in front of my students, especially in the apprenticeship program, because these, these, uh, apprentices are already at work, so they're a little bit savvy, and it's like teaching college at that level.So, yeah, I studied hard, and, and, and I thought, wow, it's just You're right on. It's as they learn, I do too. [00:06:27] Patrick Hart: Yeah. And so they're kind of helping keep you accountable too, right?[00:06:30] Christine Leone: Absolutely # CHANGING CAREERS[00:06:31] Patrick Hart: That's great. Was it, you know, when you started, because you were working for different companies, I believe, and then you went on to start your own, you know, your own company. Was that a nervous time for you to, you know, to kind of leave the comfort maybe of more secured, you know, uh, job situation then go on your own, you know, take your own path? [00:06:54] Christine Leone: Yeah. I like it to jumping off the cliff, but, and so, yes, very, because I, I was secure my, I mean, I had a job. I wasn't leaving because I wasn't enjoying my work.At that point I was in a, back in industrial and I was managing, you know, people and, And, but it was, it was a time for me to go out and, you know, strike out on my own and make my own hours and, and take on that responsibility. And it was, it was pretty, it was, it was difficult to leave that job that was secure and not know, am I going to make it?I'm not, am I not going to make it? I mean, I really, you know, I had never run a business before, but I decided to, hey, Now's the time. So I jumped off that cliff and I never looked back. Well, I think that was definitely the right thing to do. [00:07:50] Patrick Hart: Yeah, I think that's really inspiring, you know, for you to do that.And was there, you know, did you have to learn some things that you hadn't previously known? You know, maybe kind of the back end, stuff of like running a company like bookkeeping and maybe like insurance stuff. Was that a challenge or did you have people helping you?[00:08:08] Christine Leone: Yeah, well, when you, when you take your contractor's license, half of the education or half of the test is law, business law.So I had already started studying about business law. So that I could pass my test and also so that I could, you know, know what was required legally. And also, yeah, I sought out help. Definitely, I had a tax advisor and business consultant. And I mean, as I, you know, I would get to the end of my natural ability.The better I got at noticing when I was at the end of my natural ability, the easier it was for me because I started asking for help, or I sought out help for the things that weren't my field of expertise because I was an electrician. The good part is that my responsibility when I work for other companies is that I ran large projects, so I knew how to manage projects.I was good at project management. I knew how to watch the money, and I think it's really important to be a good leader if you're going to own your own business. So I did go to University of California and take a leadership course because I got to the end of my natural ability on what to do sometimes when it came to leadership and management.So I took a leadership and management, uh, certification course for one semester and that, that really catapulted me into another level. And the other thing is, I think the biggest thing when you're starting a business, at least in, in my trade, I had to learn how to bid and estimate work correctly and know how long it took to do things and know what things cost, because a business can go down in its first five years very easily, or even less than that, if you don't understand bidding. So that's what I had to really learn. [00:10:15] Patrick Hart: Did you learn some of, you know, maybe some of that side of the business when you were working for the other companies? Did that help you? [00:10:22] Christine Leone: I learned a lot. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I think that my experience and background actually set me up to, you know, for success in that, in that arena, because that was my job as project management too.I actually, some of the, some of the projects I developed myself. So yeah definitely. [00:10:43] Patrick Hart: Yeah. And I think it's great too, that you had, you know, the self awareness to realize maybe as you put, you were at the end of your natural ability. So you went out. And took a class, you know, so you could educate yourself and, you know, go further.And also, you know, you talked about asking for help. And I think that's great, you know, to be vulnerable, right? And task for help, because you're not only helping yourself, but you're helping the, it makes the other person feel good, right? When you ask them for help and they can help you. [00:11:11] Christine Leone: Right. Absolutely. I think it's important to find mentors no matter where you are. I mean at my age and the stage that, I mean, I've been, oh, I don't know, like 50 years in this trade now, including my, you know, educating, that there's always something to learn and there's always help that we can get.And we, I just always continue to look for mentors and, you know, in my opinion, never stop learning. # MAIN DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES[00:11:44] Patrick Hart: Agreed. Do you want to talk about just what your main duties and responsibilities looked like when you were running your own company? [00:11:54] Christine Leone: So, at some point in time, I was not a large company.I was a, small company, which was manageable for me. I had about eight employees, plus an office person, and then like I said, I had people that did my payroll, and now there's QuickBooks and all this other, all this easier kind of way to get that done. But I actually, you know, had a payroll person and I had an office manager that did dispatching.So a lot of those kinds of things and paid my bills and all that. So I got to hire out for that and I had an office. So that allowed me to, what, what you do as an owner, or what I did as an owner, is that I have to stay ahead of my employees. You have to find work, so you have to sell. I didn't think I was much of a salesperson until I started my own company.And then I realized that I love what I do, so I was selling what I love and I believed in what I do. And especially when I got out of commercial and into residential and I was more one on one with my customer, that it was really fun to, to educate them on a trade that they don't know anything about and And make it not scary and keep them safe and tell them why we're keeping them safe and why they need certain things.So selling is an art and I just, you know, because I loved what I do, that's, that was a big part of my job because if I didn't sell and I, and I didn't land work and I didn't bid correctly, so I didn't get the work and I couldn't keep my employees. And if you can't, if you have a high turnover, then it's hard to do the kind of work that.You know, it's hard to find people that represent the way you want work done. So it's really all tied in to keeping everybody on the job, and then once everybody's, and once it's rocking and you've got work, you know, out in front of you three months, now in this, in these times of change, you know, the trades have had a lot of work.Although it's slowing down. It's starting to look like a seasonal sometimes, and it slows down a little bit in the winter and then picks up again in the spring, but, but, oops, I lost my train of thought. Where was I going with that? [00:14:27] Patrick Hart: Well, I was going to ask you too, you were talking about, you know, that you would have to sell, right, to generate new, you know, clients and, and also maybe like referral, like referrals, I would imagine help in that line of work, right? Getting referred to by other people.[00:14:43] Christine Leone: Absolutely. I actually pride several times to, advertise, you know, on either Craigslist or the internet or via the telephone book. I did that. It never brought me the kind of work that word of mouth did. So it was really important that my employees represent in a manner that suited me so that people would pass the word around. They hire me on the electric because. You know, they're reliable, we trust them, we trust the work they do, and it was also really important for me not to overcharge. I was fair in when I charged people, and I learned a long time ago from a very wise person, Always give something away, you know, even if it's a little, Hey, can you add another district?Oh, sure. Nah, no problem. We're there. I'll no charge on that. And I think, you know, with that kind of mindset, I didn't have to advertise. [00:15:52] Patrick Hart: Oh, that's great. And yeah, thank you for sharing that. And I'd imagine that reputation goes a long ways, right? In the trades and elsewhere, just in life. [00:16:03] Christine Leone: Yep, definitely.# CAREER SKILLS[00:16:06] Patrick Hart: Thanks for sharing that, Chris. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the What-To-Be show on KSQD, Santa Cruz, 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and I'm speaking with Chris Leone, who's the owner of Leone electric and instructor of ABC NorCal. Chris, do you want to talk about some of the skills that you've used in your career?[00:16:28] Christine Leone: Yeah, sure. So the theory of electricity is the same no matter what the method is. And there are several methods. There's residential, commercial and industrial. Those 3 methods are the 3 primary methods for I mean, you have low voltage, other kinds of things, but those are the 3 general electrical methods. Methods we use in residential is, you know, drilling a lot of holes in wood and pulling a lot of romex and setting boxes and hanging lighting. And, uh, so there's that, that end of it. And then when you get into commercial and industrial, you're actually installing conduits. You know, with EMT, a metal conduit could be rigid or thin wall EMT, so you learn how to bend the conduit and install conduit and pull conductors and do what we call make up.Make up is actually tying all the wiring together and then trim is, You know, putting in all the devices, whether it be a transformer or a single pole switch in a residential home, so all of that. And then industrial, I enjoy industrial. I started out as an industrial electrician. You do the conduit, you do the blowing of wire, but you do motor control Motor control is really fun, and then later on, and today, actually, motors and timers and relays and all of this control work is all controlled by a programmable logic control in PLC, so everything is very different than when I started, but I was in the business still when PLCs came about, which is basically you're, in fact, some of the software people from the phone side are starting to get into electrical because there's so much programming involved at that level now. So there's all these opportunities for people with different skill sets today that weren't then, but it's changing. So we still need workers on the ground, people that can run conduit, the mechanical side.We need people that understand theory for troubleshooting. And we need programmers that can actually say when this pump starts, then that valve shuts and this conveyor belt starts, stuff like that, all that logic control. So, there's a lot to do and I've done all of that. And so, yeah. Okay. Is there anything else there?[00:19:16] Patrick Hart: Oh, that was great. And I just was going to ask, you know, what kind of person do you think would enjoy becoming an electrician and maybe starting their own company? [00:19:25] Christine Leone: People that like to work with their hands. People that like to solve problems, troubleshooting side, people that like to be challenged mentally.I want to say this for anybody that thinks they might want to be an electrician but are afraid of the math. I got, like, I was the kid in school that had my hand up constantly in algebra. I made it through geometry and that's as far as I got. Math was not my forte, however, I ran a business for over 25 years, and I've been an electrician for all these years on the math that I know.And so, I want to say, if you are afraid of math, don't be. You can be an electrician, easily. You can run your own business, easily, and not be a math expert. There's, it's really not hard to learn electrical math, unless you get up into the engineering side. So, that might have, might have taken a little left hand turn there, but, I think maybe where you're going Patrick is, we want to talk to the people that might be interested in doing this trade and I want to say that because I've heard so many people say, yeah, but I'm afraid of the math. I can't do math. I'm just saying, don't be if you're mechanically inclined. I think it's a great opportunity.I, I got lucky. I had a grandfather that started teaching me how to hammer a nail when I was three or four. I was probably four when he bought me my first hammer. Okay. And my dad continued that. # PRE-CAREER JOURNEY[00:21:11] Patrick Hart: Did you think that, did you kind of know at a young age that you might pursue a career in one of the trades?[00:21:18] Christine Leone: Yeah, it's funny because, I went to high school in, from 1964 to 1968. My dream was that I had a big four wheel drive truck with my name on the side as a contractor. I didn't know I was going to be an electrician. I just knew I wanted to be in construction. Uh, I don't know very many women that in those, in that era have that dream and maybe not even now.But I had the dream. I never thought it would come true. You know, I thought, Oh, everybody said, Oh, you should be a teacher. You should be a secretary. You should be a this or that. And I wasn't interested in that. And my dream came true.[00:22:00] Patrick Hart: Well, I think that's great. And I'd imagine it's possible that you have inspired, you know, many, uh, women into knowing that they can too, you know, pursue a career in the trades and become an electrician like yourself.[00:22:13] Christine Leone: I have. Can I put a plug in for, for somebody that used to work for me? I won't name names, but I had a woman that worked for me. I like to hire women, but it was, really I would have liked to hire more women, but it was hard to get women to be interested.But I hired a woman, and she worked for me for several years, and she had an opportunity to either take her journey test, or go out on her own, take her C10 contractor's license test, and start her own business, which is what she did. And she's been out there in Santa Cruz County, and very, very successful.I've been keeping my eye on her. And she's doing great, and I'm secretly proud of you all. I really didn't have anything to do with it other than training her, but I'm so happy. And she actually heard that I was thinking about retiring and, uh, I'm going to go back to work for her and her own business.So it's come full circle. Shee worked for me and now I'm going to go work for her and I'm really excited. [00:23:21] Patrick Hart: That's so cool. And that, you know, I'm not sure if that answers my next question, but I was going to ask, you know, maybe what's your, favorite or most rewarding part of your job? [00:23:30] Christine Leone: Yeah, stuff like that or when I see people that I, the first school that I taught at in San Jose was, we taught a lot of hard to serve, you know, jails, institutions, gang related, you know, they were just not an easy life for them. So our program, and we had grants and school loan funding to be able to get, help get people a leg up.And in that program, and I was there almost 10 years, I saw so many just life changing stories. And that just, you know, when my, it just filled my heart. And even when I knew, oh my God, if I went back into the field, I'd be making so much more money, but I fell in love. I fell in love with my students, and I fell in love with being a conduit for uplifting them and giving them a leg up.And time after time after time, I saw people come out of places that was, you know, with jails, institutions, or death. And now they're thriving. [00:24:38] Patrick Hart: Well, thank you so much for doing what you do. That's, yeah, that's so meaningful. Chris, did anything surprise you know, when you became an electrician that you want to share? Or maybe starting your own company. [00:25:03] Christine Leone: I'm trying to think about, let me think about that. You know, a question I get a lot is, I was thinking about this today when I knew I was going to be on the show, I'm not sure this answers, but let me say this anyway. The question that I've gotten from a lot of people being a woman in the trades, especially when I started, which maybe there was 1 percent females, not much, it's six or eight now, not much better, but how was it for you growing up basically in a business or starting a business or being in a quote man's trade or a man's world, not that woman friendly.And my answer to that is, you know, maybe I was blind, but I just put my head down and said, I can do this. And the surprise I think was, is that I was able to, and I have to say it wasn't that difficult for me because I, I don't know, maybe I just wasn't afraid and, and maybe that's the surprise too.I might have seemed to be afraid in the beginning, but then once I got into it, I was like, Oh, this isn't that scary at all. Yeah. And I'd be really good at what you do and, and know your stuff and be prepared and show up and things start to fall in place and people stop giving you a hard time. [00:26:38] Patrick Hart: That's so awesome and that must have felt pretty empowering too. [00:26:43] Christine Leone: It was, it was very empowering. It was fun to see. The men that when I first started in my industrial career, well, you know, often I would walk onto a job site and men had not seen a woman on a job site before. So it was the same, it was like, I kind of got the, what are you doing here look and I just did what I do, which is work hard and learn and ask questions and go to them and you know, see if they would mentor me. One quick story. He was the last holdout. He just could not take it that there was a woman in his, you know, his field. And, one night I was the only electrician on his, all his equipment went down and his whole canning area was dead. 45 minutes later I had him up and running. And it was after that, oh man, I was just anything I wanted from him, he gave me.And I think that's all we have to do is just prove that we really want to be there and we care about the team. Right. It's all about the team. [00:27:59] Patrick Hart:  I think you're great. Thank you for sharing that. That's very inspiring. It probably shows that you're showing other people how much you care and that you're passionate about doing a good job.And I think no matter what people most likely respect that. Do you think in the next minute you can provide some resources to students or anyone listening who might want to pursue a career? Sure. [00:28:19] Christine Leone: Absolutely. Well, there's, there's, ABC NorCal, Associated Builders and Contractors that I'm teaching for right now.And they're in Livermore, if you go abcnorcal.org and there's a number of programs that we have there, electrical, labor, construction. and painting right in Livermore. You don't have to drive to Livermore all the time. It's not like that. You, if you look up on the website, you can find out abcnorcal.org. Also a center for employment training in San Jose is a trade tech school. They have, a nursing, they have HVAC, building and construction, electrical. There's a tech program for, uh, medical assistants. I think they're doing a low voltage course now, so, and they're a little closer in San Jose.They also provide, financial aid if you happen to be a farm worker or family of a farm worker, then there's grants available for you there. I would suggest that education is the first place to start. Especially for my trade for electrical, because it's really important to have a certification or be a state recognized.If you have education, you will excel. You can go out there and learn the hard way, or you can, you know, get book smart and, and trade smart. So on the job training or on the job learning, as we call it now, plus, educational programs together, I feel is really important. [00:30:12] Patrick Hart: That's awesome. Chris, I want to thank you so much for being such an inspiring, guest today and sharing your great career story. I really appreciate you taking your time to help us out. [00:30:24] Christine Leone: Well, it's my pleasure, Patrick. Thank you for having me.[00:30:27] Patrick Hart: Absolutely.
