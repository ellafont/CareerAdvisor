Oh, you're very welcome. Alison, do you want to briefly describe your career journey for us?

Allison Paradise  1:05  
Yes, although briefly might be challenging. To my best.

Interviewer  1:09  
Thank you.

Allison Paradise  1:10  
Yeah, I am going to start from the very, very beginning. When I was three years old, my parents purchased a book that I used all the way through high school that asked at the end of every year questions like, What do you want to be when you grew up, and who your friends were and what classes you liked and things like that. And at the end of my first preschool year, we sat down with this book, and my mother asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. And I said a teacher. And she looked at me very confused. And she said, You can't do that. And I didn't understand. So I just went on with my life. And the next year happened. And we opened up the book. And I said, teacher, and she said again, no, pick something else. And I think by then I'd probably started gymnastics. So I added gymnasts to just so that we could move on. And every year this would happen. And every year, she would say you need to do something else, you can't do that. And by the time I was 12, I had long since forgotten about teacher because it's already been told I couldn't do that. And I had formulated this idea in my mind that I needed to do something that was meaningful. That was really what she kept saying, and not that she didn't think teachers did meaningful work, because interestingly, she herself was a teacher, she just had it in her mind that I could do more than whatever it was that she was doing in the classroom. And we were asked that year in school, what do you want to be when you grow up? And then we had to do a whole report about it. I chose neurosurgeon. I'm not I can make up a story about why I chose neurosurgeon. I mean, I thought the brain was interesting. I knew that surgery was really challenging. I thought if I combine these two things, it would be the most challenging, highest possible level that I could achieve. And that's what it seemed like everybody was pushing me towards. That's probably why I chose it. I honestly, don't remember exactly why, but it stuck. The real challenge was that it stuck. Everybody got really excited. Oh my gosh, you're going to be a neurosurgeon. We're going to have the first neurosurgeon and the family and everybody in my small town became really, really supportive of this idea. So that when I went to college, I was pre med so that I could be a neurosurgeon. And if you'd asked me when I was 18, about this choice to become a neurosurgeon, I would have told you a story about this choice. And it would have sounded really, really convincing. I would have shared with you books I had read and that I had volunteered in a hospital and met people. I'd even done surgery, somehow the small town I grew up in let me do surgery when I was in high school. So I'd had all of these experiences and I could create this amazing story about about why I wanted to be a neurosurgeon. So I go away to university. And within the first year, I get really, really sick. And I'm having these incredibly intense stomach pains, nobody can figure out what's going on. And by my sophomore year, the pains were so bad that I was missing classes sometimes. And I couldn't figure it out. So I thought, something's not right here. And I took the summer between my sophomore and junior years to go to Spain to live there for the summer. I had been studying neuroscience, obviously, and also Spanish literature. So I spoke a bit of Spanish and I had been to Spain in a class trip when I was 15. And it struck me as the right place to go. And at this time, there was obviously there was internet and there were phones and things I'm not quite that old, but it was not as ubiquitous as it is now. So when I left to go to Spain or I really separated myself from my friends and my family. And being there in a foreign country with a language that I spoke, but learned quickly, I was actually not fluent in despite what the university was telling me. I had a lot of time to reflect, I had a journal, and I would write in it every day to try to understand what was happening with me. Why was I so miserable, I was at a great university, and loved the University where I was. And there was a wonderful community of people who were supporting me and everything I kept saying, I wanted to do so what was wrong. And what I came to see, of course, is that I didn't want to be a doctor, I had no interest in being a doctor, I wanted to be teacher, I am a teacher. And there was no reason for me to be have gone down this path of, of thinking, I want to be a doctor. And when I started to resolve where these ideas had come from, and all of the social expectations and all of the social conditioning, and all of the things that were told about who we shouldn't be, and those started to come away, I felt myself emerging. And I felt really strong. I came back to Providence, I was in school in Rhode Island, and, and then I was back in everything, again, with my family and my friends and the university and I, I managed to not be pre med. But I didn't quite escape far enough to be able to do the thing that was in my heart. And I started doing research. And I'd actually been doing research since high school in laboratories, I worked at a pharmaceutical company when I was in high school. And then I my freshman year I was working in a lab that worked on neuronal circuitry modeling, it's been so long since I've had to think about this, I'm pretty sure that's the right thing. It's what we worked on was in essence, the precursor to that neural link thing that Elon Musk is developing. So I worked in a lab that did that. And then I worked in a lab that looked at muscular dystrophy. Anyway, I did a lot of research, and I graduated college, and I wanted to start a school. And that the idea for the school was to create a space where people could follow what was truly in their hearts, and not have all of these things that you're supposed to be or things you're supposed to do floating around in the space. But everyone told me I couldn't do it because I'd graduated with degrees in neuroscience and Spanish literature, not with a degree in education. And I had no experience. And there were all these reasons why I couldn't do it. So I went back into research because it was something I knew how to do. And I spent two years in between undergrad and grad school, doing research. Then I went to graduate school for neuroscience research, and I was getting my PhD. And I was miserable. I mean, I'm just, I'm not a bad scientist, I'm quite a good scientist, but I don't enjoy it. It's not who I am. And I left the Ph. D program, which created a lot of stress. I was in a Ph. D. Program at Harvard for neuroscience. And as you can imagine all the pressure that was being put on me by family and friends that led to my deciding to go to that place. When I finally said I can't do this anymore. It was it was almost catastrophic. And people were begging me to stay and saying you're throwing away your life and what it's going to become a view and I can't believe you would waste this opportunity. And I left and I moved across the country to Los Angeles. And then I worked as a consultant for a few years, which I'm going to gloss over because it's very uninteresting. For me personally, it was it was really just something I needed to do to not be doing research and to be doing something else and be able to live. And then in 2013, I looked at my life and I thought what am I doing? What is this even? This is not what three year old five year old me wanted for my life. And I left my consulting job. And I started a nonprofit called migraine lab that focused on sustainability and science. So again, I didn't quite go in the direction where I had, where I really wanted to go, because people kept telling me I couldn't do that. But this was sort of a way for me to start to do that. Because I was able to go and talk to people about sustainability and science, which at the time really wasn't a thing. And the approach they took to talking to people about it was questioning their behavior. So asking why and I actually gave a talk about this. There's a TED talk about this called our little world if you're interested can watch kind of how that philosophy of questioning our behavior, why we do things the way that we do. What's so powerful in transforming people's relationship with themselves and their work and the planet because now rather than saying you should do this, people were able to To understand, well is this something that I that's really true for me is this the best choice for me for my work for the planet for the situation that I'm in. And I did that for seven years, and the nonprofit became this a global enterprise. And, and it continues, but I left I resigned in 2020. To start the epicenter. I didn't know that I was starting the epicenter, when I resigned, I just felt that I had created something that was getting really big, I was flying all over the world, lots of recognition for the work that I was doing, and had started a global movement and laboratory sustainability. And if I didn't leave, that was going to be the rest of my life, we'd be having this conversation about my life trajectory that had me start this massive, nonprofit, and about all the wonderful things that that has led to, and that still wasn't me. So finally, it's taken me a very, very long time. Finally, I'm doing the thing that I'm meant to do. And it doesn't look like a school anymore. The idea is to create a retreat center, where younger people can come for a week or two weeks, to essentially do what I was able to do in Spain, which is get away from all of the social expectations, all the social conditioning and reconnect with their authentic selves, and recognize, truly recognize their limitless potential.

Interviewer  11:28  
Oh, my gosh, I don't know what to say. That's your career journey is amazing. And, and congratulations on, on what you're doing now at the epicenter. And for all the other work that you've done, you know, leading you to, you know, to be on your, your true path. Is that right?

Allison Paradise  11:47  
That's what it feels like. I mean, this is the closest I feel I've ever come to, to what I imagined my life would be when I was a kid. Do

Interviewer  11:58  
you think that? Do you think that it's hard for people to, to do that for themselves? Because they get because of you know, what society tells them to do? You know, they get kind of like locked in to what they think they're supposed to do?

Allison Paradise  12:12  
Oh, yeah, it's so difficult. It's so so difficult. Because everything in wherever you are in the world is pointing you in one, one general direction. And, and I can think back to when I got married, I think getting married is such a great example. Because it it takes us outside of the job sphere, which I think can be a little bit more sensitive for people. I never wanted to be married. It just wasn't didn't suit me. I knew I didn't want to do it. And I did it anyway. Because when I told people that I was going to be getting married, everyone rallied around me, it was the most amazing feeling. It was the first time actually in my whole life, I felt like I was doing something that was right, because everybody was on board. Everyone said, Oh, my gosh, that's so wonderful. We're so happy for you, we're so excited for you. And it felt really good except, except that it felt nothing like me. And when the day came, I was so I felt so stressed for myself, not because of the wedding or whatever, because I couldn't care less about it. But because it was so antithetical to my being. And I think that that's what makes it so hard for us to, to leave things, or to not stay in things. Because everything around us is supporting the choice. An argue is really not a choice. But the decision to be in that situation. When I was a consultant, everyone told me, I should stay a consultant because I made a lot of money. And it took a lot for me to be able to say, You know what, I don't care about the money, I'm going to start a nonprofit, which is not a terribly lucrative thing to do. The same thing with a nonprofit, being in that space, where there's all this recognition takes so much effort to just walk away from all of that. And so what's really necessary in order to do that is to step outside of society for a little while, whether it's a week, someplace, or I took a month in a cabin by myself, with no internet, no phone, no communication, and it was in that space that I could really see clearly what I was doing. It's almost impossible to see what we're doing with all that's going on around us.

Interviewer  14:27  
Right? Our worlds have become so noisy and everything's moving so fast. And people don't really seem like they have a lot of patience these days. I think a lot of and then oftentimes and maybe even myself like people can get nervous when they're unplugged when they don't have the noise. I mean, not me so much because I love being outdoors. But for some people, especially people who live in a city, I mean if you put them out in the forest somewhere where it's very quiet, they might have a lot of anxiety, you know from that and I can't be very healthy, I don't think, you know, we're supposed to, you know, be staring at the screens as much as we do these days. And, but I love I really love your perspective and the work that you're doing. And I just want to take a quick break and let people know for all those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the what to be show on que es que de Santa Cruz 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart, and I'm speaking with Alison paradise, who is the founder and CEO of the epicenter, which is in an organization that provides an experience of empowerment. And Alison, do you mind telling us a little bit more about what you're doing with the epicenter? Oh,

Allison Paradise  15:39  
D. My pleasure. Thank you for asking. Yeah, the, as I mentioned, the vision for the epicenter is to create a retreat space where people can come for a week or two weeks, and really be outside of, of society, in a space that has no judgment, is full of trust, and starts with open ended questions about who you are. It's also all outside in nature, because nature provides a perfect mirror for us to be able to see how to behave naturally. Because when you look outside, you see the tree is just itself, it's, it's completely entirely a tree. And I like to use this analogy, because I often feel like, and this is I should preface this by saying this is no judgement, this happens to every single person, myself included, it's a product of the environment that we grew up in, a lot of us are born, let's say, as redwood trees, and we're told by someone in our lives, or multiple people in our lives, or our culture, that you'd really be better off being a blueberry bush. And so we just try desperately to be blueberry bushes, but our nature is a redwood tree. And that's why I like doing things outside. Because you can really, you can really connect with the true nature of things and have that mirror back for yourself what your true nature is, the retreat center doesn't exist yet. It's something that we're working towards creating. So in the absence of that we've been hosting classes here in santa cruz through the Parks and Rec Department, and also in various other locations where there space that people will let us have classes, we've been working with people who are ages seven to 22. Although I've also worked personally with people who are older, in particular, with adults and parents, we also do a lot of one on one mentorship. So the kinds of things that I'm sharing now, these are the types of ideas that get brought up in those guidance sessions, where there's a lot of questions that are asked about the choices that have been made in someone's life in order to get them to a place where they can see themselves more clearly and connect with their authentic self. I absolutely love doing that. We've been working with college students and high school students in particular, to do that type of work. We also have a series of videos on the website that ask open ended questions out in nature. And they're very, very short because for to your point, we don't really want people to be sitting in front of a screen for very long. Some of the questions invite you to go outside and explore. Some of them are involved art projects, to give an example of an open ended question that doesn't have a right answer. The first video asked the question, What sound does Iraq make? Which is an interesting question and read it? Yeah. Yeah. It's a fun question that came to me walking in Elkhorn slew of all places. I was just walking, and I looked at a rock and I thought, I wonder what sound you make? And I thought, Wow, that's a really interesting question. And then I thought, if I were to draw the color of Birdsong, what would that look like? And I thought, Well, we really, we really don't think about our senses in this way is how they're all they all are really combined. We try to separate them out, but, but they're not really separate. And that's where the idea came from. And it's been, it's been a lot of fun. And I've really enjoyed sharing this perspective through this through the video, since we're unable to do a lot of this work in person still at the moment. Yeah.

Interviewer  19:18  
And do you have any idea or like, where you might want to open the center that you're envisioning? I

Allison Paradise  19:27  
found a place that matched what I had drawn on a piece of paper up in Mendocino. I don't know if we'll be able to make that happen or not. That's perfect. But if it doesn't work out, I'm sure another perfect place will appear. It's really where it wants to be not where I think it should be.

Interviewer  19:47  
Okay, and you shared with me before the interview, that you were involved with a, an art installation, downtown at the Martha Museum of Art History. Do you want to tell us a little bit about that? Oh,

Allison Paradise  19:58  
thank you. So we created a piece called entanglement for the frequency Festival at the MA. Oh, that happened in September. And this was very much related to the work that I'm sharing because fundamental to the work at the epicenter is having experiences, you'll probably notice a thread as I've been chatting that a lot of our decisions about what to do with our life don't come from experience of our own selves they come from what other people are telling us is their experience or the collective experience. And because experience, a true experience is so important for being able to see ourselves, we wanted to create a piece that provided an experience of what we call entanglement. The idea of entanglement came from quantum entanglement, which if you're familiar with this, I'm going to now reduce it to a very, very simple explanation. So apologies if you're familiar with it, you're going to be very annoyed at this explanation. And if you're not, it'll be great, because it's very easy. The idea is that in quantum entanglement, that two particles act on each other, even though they're spatially separated. So in essence, one particles behavior affects another particles behavior, even though they're, they're not touching each other. And this idea, I had done some work on consciousness, I helped write a book on consciousness a few years ago, and one of the ideas that came out of that book was, was a perspective that perhaps entanglements exists on a very large scale. And we call that entanglement at large. So the geodesic dome that we created, had lasers and sound. And when you crossed the laser beam, it would produce a sound. And it would also change the color of a beam and the sound and another part of the geodesic dome. So in this way, everything everyone did in the space was instantaneously and simultaneously affecting everyone and everything around them. So in essence, acting on someone or affecting someone or something without actually touching it physically. And that experience is incredibly profound, because that perspective, that everything you do instantaneously and simultaneously affects everyone and everything around you, helps with an understanding of there being no separation between us. And this is just a perspective, it's not saying that this is truth with a capital T, this perspective can be very, very valuable, particularly when we try to understand things that are happening to us, seemingly happening to us in life, if we're speaking with another person, and there's a conflict that's arising, you sort of start to understand, well, if there's no separation, that means I'm contributing to this in some way. Everything is being co created with all of us all the time. And it really changes how you interact with with yourself, other people, and in particular with a planet.

Interviewer  22:59  
Well, that sounds it's very beautiful. And do you think that what you're doing with the epicenter is particularly timely, you know, with everything going on in the world, and things slowing down for a lot of people, and I think maybe more people are having time to kind of reevaluate what they're doing, you know, maybe like you have in your life?

Allison Paradise  23:21  
That's a really good observation. It might be I, I really appreciate that question. I think for some people, yes. Or others, particularly as we're trying to work with younger children, not so much, because I think parents of younger children I've been feeling are in a different place than perhaps the college students that I'm working with who are much more reflective, self reflective now then, even five, six years ago.

Interviewer  23:56  
Alison, do you want to tell us kind of like what your typical day or week looks like with the work you're doing with epicenter?

Allison Paradise  24:04  
Yeah, a typical week is that it's a hard one to, to come up with, because nothing is typical about this. But I will, I will share with with you what let's say the next few weeks look like. Since this is a project that it's just getting started. I left it as I mentioned in 2020, it took me some time to to really understand what this what this was going to be. I had tried to work with adults for a little while, just adults, and that was not as satisfying. I found. So anyway, I'm getting something started, which means that I spend a lot of the day reaching out to people to see if there's a way for us to collaborate or a way that I can contribute to their existing work with this perspective and this philosophy. There's also a lot of conversations about I'd mentioned wanting to create this retreat center so a lot of conversations about how that might happen. It's very much about connections. So meeting people who might know somebody who might know somebody else you might know somebody else. So I spend a lot of time talking to people. Unfortunately, often through zoom, though I try either to meet in person or speak over the phone, because I have a very hard time being in front of a screen for a long periods of time, especially after I had mentioned, I was away from all devices for a while. And aside from the meetings, the rest of the day I spend in reflection, that process of writing down why I was doing the things, the way that I did them that I started in Spain, is something that has only has only grown, as I've gotten older, and there were periods in my life where I didn't write at all, but that has changed. I write every day, I reflect on what's happening, I try to understand what's going on. And then I sit quietly, for long stretches in the day, just not thinking, just being trying to feel what's around me. And that's a lot of what my day looks like. And that's how I can have those meetings and not get attached or sucked into the traditional entrepreneurship route. Because I've done that before when I started the nonprofit, my green lab, and it's very easy to get kind of sucked into that whole thing. Yeah.

Interviewer  26:31  
And it just maybe builds upon itself as it goes. It seems like an overall theme with maybe yourself and for what you want to do out there. It seems like it's connecting with yourself and connecting with other people. Right? Yes,

Allison Paradise  26:46  
in an in an authentic space? Yes.

Interviewer  26:50  
I appreciate that very much. And can you give any advice or resources for people who are interested in getting involved with work in alignment with what you do?

Allison Paradise  27:03  
Well, for sure, I would say reach out to me, please don't hesitate to reach out to me this talking about these sorts of things is my favorite thing to do in the whole world. And it feels like the whole reason that I exist on the planet, so please don't hesitate to send an email at the website for the epicenters B so the the word be E dash, the dash epicentre.org. But if you Google the epicenter and Santa Cruz, it should come right up as a please definitely reach out. In terms of other resources for for this type of work. There are well, there are quite a few. The book I would recommend by Alan Wah, and the little prince that was easily accessible. The Little Prince is a phenomenal book, and has a lot of great insight that can just help. When you're feeling like things are overwhelming to remind you what's essential about being Oh, that's great. Yeah,

Interviewer  28:10  
maybe starting with those two? Yes. Thank you for providing that, Allison. And can you give any advice to people out there who maybe are unsure about their career path, who maybe feel trapped in their career, maybe not sure in which direction to go,

Allison Paradise  28:26  
you're in a great spot. That's actually the best spot to be in when you think when you feel like you don't know, because then you're the most open to receiving the direction. The advice I would give is, what I did, because it really works is to sit down and write, write about how you got to where you are, what influenced the decisions that you've made. And then think back in particular, when you're thinking about what it is that you want to do with your work? The question I often ask people is think back to when you were small, because when we were three, four or five years old, we didn't have an idea of who we were supposed to be? Yes, it was swirling around us. But there was enough of our authentic self that was available and accessible to us that we were able to express it. And you can see this, I obviously didn't add this to the day. But obviously I work quite a bit with kids. And you can see this when you when you're working with especially younger kids that there are these things that they can't help but do and I don't mean and in a way that's negative or some sort of bad behavior or something like that. I mean, truly things that if you leave them alone for five minutes, they just start to do the thing that's in them. So when you reflect on where it is that you really that's really truest to you think back to when you were small. What was it that you loved to do? What was it that you couldn't help but do and then as you get as you kind of reflect when you get older. Think about the thing As it you can't help but do even now. So for me, for example, I can't help but talk about these things. It's probably pretty obvious from this conversation. I love talking about these things. So if you put me in a party, which was pretty much my nightmare, but if I had to be in some sort of party situation, this is the kind of conversation I would be having. Those are the things that are truest to you, because they keep coming up to the surface. So when you look back at your life, think about those things. What was it that you love to do when you were a kid? And what is it that you can't help but do now? And that should help start guiding you on the path towards what's truest for you, Allison,
