#CAREER JOURNEY 
[00:01:13] Interviewer: 
Thank you, Chloe. Would you please would you briefly describe your career journey for us? 
[00:01:17] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Sure. So, You know, currently, I'm the city clerk for the city of Capitola, and my career journey, I think, has been full of stops and starts, so I don't know exactly how to share, but I started working at the city four and a half years ago in a different role, but within the clerk's office, and through a series of events, I think I was kind of just in the right place at the right time.
The pandemic hit, of course, in March 2020. And the current city clerk was in the process of retiring early due to some health concerns. So the city was really put in a position of not really knowing who was going to fill that role, and all of a sudden there was a pandemic, no one knew what to do, there was a hiring freeze, and I was there.
With a little bit of experience and, you know, kind of a can do attitude. And I was lucky enough to have, um, you know, my, my boss believe in me and, and appoint me as an interim clerk at that time. So that's kind of how I got to that role. And I think just being prepared and having been paying attention to what went on in that office for the couple of years before that moment. Really set me up to do my best at least to hopefully succeed in the position. So I hope that answers your question a little bit.


[00:02:41] Interviewer: 
Know. Yeah. Thank you very much. And so do you want to talk a little, a little bit about what a city clerk does and does the city of Capitola have more than one clerk?


[00:02:53] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Absolutely. So it's a good question. And you know, five years ago, I wouldn't have necessarily known the answer to it either. So I think it's kind of fun to think about, you know, you may find yourself in a role that you didn't even know existed until you're kind of, your eyes are opened to it, and the city clerk, so the city of Capitola has one, only me, we have a deputy clerk who, um, works with me, which is fantastic, but basically what a city clerk does for, um local government is you're kind of The conduit between the public and the city council.
And so the city council are the decision makers. They put in place policy that staff like the city manager, myself and the department had then carry out. So it's kind of like top down government. Right. And me as the clerk makes sure. That certain things are done properly, like our public meetings where the city council meets and discusses and make, you know, votes, makes decisions that the public is notified properly when that's going to happen.
What are they going to be talking about? And then if anyone has questions about, you know, what's happening in the city, they would really call City Hall and probably talk to me and I would try to explain what's going on and really be open. Um, you know. transparent government, all of that is important to the clerk and to that office.




#COMMUNITY OUTREACH DURING COVID
[00:04:19] Interviewer: 
Yeah. Okay. Um, aside from, I guess, residents calling in to talk to you about something that they might have questions about, are there other ways that you relay that information?
 
[00:04:29] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Yeah, I'm actually really excited and proud of, you know, the last few years, that's been the biggest focus that I've had, especially with the pandemic.
And for quite some time, people needing to be, you know, in their home. Maybe not sure exactly what was going on. The communication and the community outreach part of the role was something I really focused on. So we went through a pretty extensive update to our website. I started sending out every two weeks, um, an electronic newsletter.
So I pulled together different information that's going on. You know, in the city at the different departments, like the police department, public works, community development, all the programs, recreation, everything that, you know, People are doing for the betterment of the community to kind of summarize it, send it out so that residents and interested parties are aware of what's happening around them.
So that is something that I'm pretty passionate about, and I think clerks are taking more of that type of a role on as things kind of change and grow just, you know, in the state and in the region. 


[00:05:37] Interviewer: 
Does your office use maybe like social media too to inform people? 


[00:05:42] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Absolutely, yes. Thank you for reminding me.
Um, and that's actually something that I started doing, um, even before I was the clerk working within the office, I thought, you know what? Capitol is a beautiful place. There's lots of cool things that happen here. We really need to have a bigger presence on Instagram and on Facebook. So we have been You know, making a push, um, we, we definitely do post more and we have those city accounts.
And I know, um, independently of myself, I know that the Capitola Police Department is pushing that as well and having, you know, doing a big effort to grow their social media presence so that the community feels like they're a part of what is going on in Capitola. 


[00:06:23] Interviewer: 
Yeah, like through good and bad, right?


[00:06:26] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Yes, exactly.


[00:06:28] Interviewer: 
So it sounds like you took your role at a, you know, a difficult time to say the least, you know, with so much going on, all kinds of different mandates happening all the time, right? Both health and different regulations. That must have been, um, yeah, interesting, right? 


[00:06:44] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Yeah, It was, it was interesting. That's a really good way of putting it. 
Yeah. And, um, It was, I don't want to say it was exciting because I know there was so many, um, there's so hard for so many people, but I did feel a sense of purpose in being in a position where I wasn't making the decisions. I wasn't an expert by any means, but at least I knew I was getting, you know, the real information, like, from county health, from the people that knew what was going on to the best of their knowledge at the time, of course.
And I felt like at least I could be a resource. For people who really didn't have a connection and really were left feeling like they were in the dark. So, being able to make sure our website was up to date and make sure I could send people, you know, the press releases and, and things that were official to get that into people's hands, that made me feel better about the situation.
Um, but it was scary and, you know, being flexible, that was a lesson I'm still learning, but, but that was very helpful is just kind of knowing things are going to change, not knowing how. But feeling like at least, you know, things will change and you can be ready when they do. 


[00:07:54] Interviewer: 
Yeah. And like trying to look for the silver linings if possible, or spin things positive can help sometimes. Yeah.
 
[00:08:02] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Absolutely. 


[00:08:03] Interviewer: 
Yeah. And your job, it sounded like, you know, you're working like in the solution. So that must have felt good, you know, doing that kind of meaningful work.


[00:08:09] Chloe Woodmansee: 
That felt better than not doing, doing it. And at least, you know, the roles felt connected in some ways. I wasn't being asked to kind of.
You know, pretend like the pandemic wasn't happening or just keep going like normal. We were definitely reacting to the situation day to day and trying to adapt and help others adapt. So that felt good. 


[00:08:35] Interviewer: 
I bet. And, you know, during a time when so many people felt disconnected, you know, it sounds like your job, it's kind of the opposite.
Like you are very connected in what's going on and, you know, that, that must have been nice. 


[00:08:48] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Yeah. That's a really good point. It did feel positive. It was overwhelming at times, but In a good way, at least it wasn't just darkness, right? I was getting the information and I felt like if someone, you know, I remember back, it feels so different.
We're still in the pandemic, but you know, two years ago around this time, people were calling City Hall to ask if the beach was open. So it just shows you. How much things change over time and sometimes it just felt good to talk to someone, um, you know, and be able to kind of commiserate and try to be just a friendly, not a friendly face, but a friendly ear for someone to talk to.


# EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND
[00:09:26] Interviewer: 
Yeah, absolutely. Chloe, do you want to share with us some of your like education background?
 
[00:09:33] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Sure. So I'm, I'm local. I'm from the area. So I, I did my, you know, earlier education in, in the area and then got a bachelor's degree from the SAMHSA. San Francisco State University and took some time, you know, after having received that degree to try to figure out what I wanted to do.
It's my life. Um, like I'm sure many that's always kind of a challenging time, and I had always really regretted, um, in college, not having done any study abroad programs. So, I started looking into different master's degrees that I could potentially, um, apply for, and I found a beautiful program in Ireland, actually, at Trinity College that I, I thought was interesting.
And so I applied. I don't even think I told anyone and I got accepted. I was shocked and so excited. So I got my master's degree in public history and cultural heritage. At Trinity in Dublin and, um, never having been to Dublin before I got there. So that was an amazing experience and really helped me kind of mature and grow as a person and also was a, was a beautiful education.
It put me kind of. In a perspective of looking outwards, and how do people perceive information, which I do think I use in my current role, because I'm trying to always think, you know, how would just an average person on the street think about this, you know, city decision that's coming up? What, what questions would they have about it?
So that I can kind of almost translate that. Back to them. What is going on? If that makes sense. 


[00:11:15] Interviewer:
Yeah, no, that sounds amazing. And yeah, I think like you were saying something about, you know, broadening your like perspective. And that I think definitely can help. Yeah, no, like, no matter what job you you work in.
Right? 


[00:11:27] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Absolutely. I think that's so important. You know, I love traveling. It always reminds me how much I love home being away as well, but it certainly opens your eyes to how big the world is and how many people there are and how many different ways of doing things there are. And I think that that's extremely valuable for, for people to gain that.


[00:11:48] Interviewer: 
Thank you. Yeah, and thank you for sharing that inspires me. Um, tomorrow meeting with the study abroad kind of they're having like a zoom information thing. I'm looking at doing that. Yeah, and I saw Ireland is one of the destinations. There's like a writing program there.


[00:12:03] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Oh, wow. 


[00:12:03] Interviewer: 
I know. So that's exciting to think about.


[00:12:06] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Well, my fingers are crossed for you because it's such a special place. Ireland is just absolutely gorgeous. So I hope that goes well for you.

# AVERAGE WEEK OVERVIEW
[00:13:09] Interviewer: 
Hi, Chloe. So I was wondering, yeah, what does your day or week look like? And, um, you know, and what kind of environments do you work in? Are you working product product? Primarily from an office where do you have a chance to go out in public at all and interact or how does that?


[00:13:26] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Yeah, that's a great question. So I am definitely mostly in city hall in the office. It's delightful because capital is city hall. For those that don't know is I don't know, maybe. Five or six blocks from the ocean. So it's a, it's really wonderful to be, of course, near the water, but also in Capitola Village, really in, in the community.
So I do try at least a couple times a day to get out, walk around, kind of see what's going on. And it's really fun because, you know, I noticed familiar faces, and I feel like I'm a small part of the community, which makes me personally really happy and, you know, the rhythm of my my weeks and my months really are based on when our city council meetings are because the big part of my job is, you know, making sure all of the materials are ready to be published on time.
You know, there's legal requirements that they're available for the public. A certain amount of time before a public meeting takes place. So really, you know, either one week, I'm working to make sure those materials are ready to be published. And then the next week we're preparing for that actual public meeting.
So just kind of flip flops back and forth between, you know, are we are we prepping or are we. Well, I guess we're prepping all the time, but are we prepping for the meeting or are we prepping for what we're going to talk about at the meeting? Basically, that's how I, that's how I explain it. 


# RELEVANT CAREER SKILLS
[00:14:54] Interviewer: 
That sounds pretty good.
And, you know, and what kind of skills would you say that you use in your job? And, and how might, have you acquired these skills, maybe through work or, um, your education background?
 
[00:15:05] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Sure. So, I think that, I don't know if this is a skill necessarily, but I think that a quality that's important is being curious and being okay with asking a lot of questions.
If I don't understand something, I need to ask to get a little more information because a lot of my job, I'm, I'm reading reports and I'm working with people. A lot of different city departments that are not my expertise. That's what their department does, right? But I'm kind of supposed to know a little bit about everything.
That's how I feel anyway. So that if people ask me or if I'm called upon to, like, speak for what's going on, I'm informed and I'm aware. So, feeling okay to ask, and then, You know, taking in that information is really important to my job. I think also having a positive attitude, you know, not everything is always great.
It can be hard. We were just talking about the pandemic. There's things changed and just staying positive and calm and realizing that, you know, some of this is very important and there are, of course, like legal requirements that we're trying to meet. But at the end of the day, you know, We have time, we can breathe, we can, we can take the time to make a, you know, a rational decision and then move forward.
So I try to kind of keep that attitude in the office so that others feel that they can as well. And that has been helpful for me in all of my jobs, but in particular in this one. 


[00:16:41] Interviewer: 
Yeah, that sounds great. You know, it sounds like you have a kind of a mindful outlook and, um, You know, I think that definitely, yeah, well, that's all we can do.
And yes. And you said, you know, asking questions, I think that's really great. Right. Because not only does it help you, I think it makes people feel good to kind of explain why, you know, the question that you asked her is like important, you know, it gives them like value too. Um, so yeah, it's kind of a win win.


[00:17:05] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Yeah, definitely. And I think too, I mean, sometimes I, I definitely deal with being shy and not warning. To put anyone out by asking for clarification and I try to remind myself, you know If if i'm thinking of this question if it's not clear to me, it might not be to other people either So it's okay to ask and probably people will be grateful that I did.
So That's the attitude. I try to have


 
# JOB FULFILLMENT
[00:17:29] Interviewer: 
I think that's great. And do you want to share maybe? You know some of the more favorite parts of your job and or you know, maybe a couple of the more stressful parts 


[00:17:39] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Sure. Let me think for a second. You know, I just, this is maybe silly, but I am personally a huge fan of Gilmore girls.
I'm sure many people are. And I feel like I work in stars hollow. Like I love knowing the people in the community and like that, a fact that I know the police chief and I can walk down the street and like see the one guy who runs that one restaurant. And I, See him every day, like putting the chairs out in the morning that warms my heart and makes me feel like I'm really part of something, which is, that's just something that I crave myself.
So I really love feeling like, you know, people recognize me when I walk down the street and it's, it's like I'm part of. their day and I can help people. So that makes me really happy. And maybe that's kind of corny, but that that is really true. That's how I feel about my job. And I think also, you know, I mentioned earlier, we started writing this newsletter more frequently and sending it out.
By email to anybody that wants to get one can it'll just automatically come to their email and it just is really high level summary. What's going on in the city? Giving information to people that might not even realize that they don't know what's going on. Now they do, and maybe they see, you know, a volunteer opportunity, or they hear about a recreation program they didn't know about that makes me feel good also, because I really think it's my job to get that information out there and make sure it's really in people's hands.
So I'm proud of that project. And I, I really do enjoy writing, you know, the issues every couple of weeks and get getting feedback that people are really reading them. That all makes me really happy. 


[00:19:20] Interviewer: 
Yeah, I think that's great. And I think it's beautiful what you were sharing about. You know, feeling that sense of community, you know, Capitola is a special place for me too.
And, you know, I love it down there and a lot of people seem to know each other and it's great when you're walking around and you see people, you know, whether, you know, anyways, yeah, a lot of great people there. And so yeah, I'm happy for you that you found that. It seems like a great city to work for.


[00:19:42] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Oh, thank you. It is. It's really, um, every day is different also. So that, that helps 




# Who is this career for
[00:19:47] Interviewer: 
very cool people. Chloe, what kind of person do you think would enjoy this kind of job? 


[00:19:53] Chloe Woodmansee: 
You know, I think that there are a lot of administrative like there's Legal things. There's rules. There's a lot of like municipal code.
So there is like detailed information. I think someone that is fascinated by like behind the scenes, how things really get done. You know, how? How do you? Those people end up there fixing the road at that place at that time. Like those kinds of questions get answered when you work for the city. So it's kind of cool.
Um, you feel like you're kind of in the know, but anybody that kind of has that attitude, I think would be good in this, in this role, you do work with all different types of people and different, um, you know, internally and with the public. So feeling friendly, you know, being. Okay, with customer service. I think that's important.
And then also maybe being able to see the big picture and not get tied down to just, you know, taking the minutes at the meeting and then getting them signed. You know, there's a lot more to it. I think to be really, really good and make have an effect in this role to be able to see, you know, I think that's really important.
What's best for the community? How can I better serve the people that live here? That is significant as well. 


# JOB SURPRISES 
[00:21:16] Interviewer: 
Yeah agreed and you know, did you find anything surprising about your job when you started?


[00:21:25] Chloe Woodmansee: 
I'm sure I did. I mean i'm sure I will tomorrow. I hear i'm always I'm always being surprised and i'm absolutely not the expert on anything So I think that helps it feels like every day is kind of new but i'm trying to think of a specific example for you Oh, um You know I think just getting to have a better understanding of really what local government does and What it means to be a city council member versus, you know, a city manager or, you know, leading a department city department that was really interesting.
And I didn't feel that I really had that until I started working for Capitola, you know, almost five years ago. So that it almost felt like I was taking a local government class, like in high school again, you know, for at the beginning. And I really found that I enjoyed that. Maybe that was surprising.


[00:22:16] Interviewer: 
Would you ever consider being like a public servant, you know, like for the city of Capitola? 


[00:22:22] Chloe Woodmansee: 
So I have thought about running for council before, you know, there's definitely a lot to that. It's extremely time consuming. I really admire all those that, that are elected officials, you know, in Capitola and. In our county, and I think, um, one thing just so you know, you do have to live in the city to run for city council, which I do not.
So there are, um, you know, reasons why that might not be in the cards for me just yet, but it definitely is something that I think about and I consider.
 
# RESOURCES FOR CAREER EXPLORATION
[00:22:55] Interviewer: 
Okay, that's great. Chloe, what advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career working for, you know, being a clerk like you are for the city of Capitola?


[00:23:07] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Sure. So I would say, you know, honestly, going to a city council meeting, if you're interested in local government or any kind of a city job would be a great place to start because you really see where kind of where everything starts because, you know, When there's a discussion at the council level, that's going to trickle down and become potentially something that staff is working on.
So you'll really get to see everybody, you know, all of the main players and start to think, you know, well, what kind of job would be interesting? And what am I gravitating towards during this meeting? And then you would really know what path you'd want to take. I think, you know, More like detailed about being a clerk, definitely having experience with writing and feeling like.
You know your way around an office. I mean a lot of these requirements are things that many people have you gain in different ways but just kind of keeping an eye out and seeing you know when things are available and maybe it's not exactly the job you want but It's in the environment you want to work in probably a good opportunity for you in that case 


[00:24:17] Interviewer: 
Okay, and did you did you have any like mentors, you know, like through your education process or?
You know, people that inspired you to, you know, continue to do what you do. Sure.
 
[00:24:29] Chloe Woodmansee: 
That's a great question. So when I first started in Capitola, the city clerk who, um, you know, who I worked for Linda was really lovely. And I learned a lot from her by just kind of sharing an office with her and, and watching her and, and kind of just getting, you know, the ins and outs and observing her, which that was helpful.
And then, um, Just kind of like bigger picture. My godmother was always super involved in the community and she worked for Comerica Bank for many years. And I, I grew up watching her as like the business lady that I looked up to. So when I found myself finally working in like a small, Town office it reminded me of when I would go visit her on her lunch breaks like in Santa Cruz And so I think that maybe had more of an effect on me than I realized.


# CAREER PATH DECISION
[00:25:20] Interviewer: 
Yeah, that's beautiful That's really cool. Thank you for sharing that Yeah, and do you have any advice for someone who is unsure about their career path? 


[00:25:33] Chloe Woodmansee:
Oh my goodness, I wish I did because I, I have felt that way so many times in the past. And I think just not losing hope and maybe trying to look outside the box and you might discover a job you didn't even realize was a job, which is really what happens to me.


[00:25:50] Interviewer: 
That's nice when that happens. 


[00:25:52] Chloe Woodmansee: 
Yeah, I know. It's like, that's not maybe the best advice, but I do think keeping an open mind is important. And follow what you love. Like, what are you really interested in? What do you find yourself doing? What have you been doing since you were little that you could potentially work within that environment or Do something similar that'll make your everyday life.
I think much much better for you. 


[00:26:18] Interviewer:
