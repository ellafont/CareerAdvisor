Lauren Del Carlo  1:04  
You're welcome. It's my pleasure.

#JOINING THE FORCE
Interviewer  1:06  
All right. And officer Del Carlo is a member of the California Highway Patrol. So to get us going, I'll start by asking how long ago did you shoot? What's the proper term join the force?

Lauren Del Carlo  1:20  
So I went to the academy in July of this 2019. And then I graduated from the academy in January of 2020. And then I just got off a break in a couple days ago, actually. So I'm off on my own. Now,

Interviewer  1:38  
what does that mean? You got you got off of breaking? Is that you what you said 

Lauren Del Carlo  1:42  
yes. So when you graduate from the academy, as an officer, you have to have it's called it's called braking. So you have four phases of training. So even though you graduate from the Academy, and you're an officer, you still have a lot to learn about the job, right? Because they can only teach you so much there this way you learn about real life scenarios and how to fill out paperwork, how to write reports better the process, you know, for booking people that you arrest had to take a traffic collision. Scene management, there's a lot that you have to learn when once you graduate the academy. So yeah, so I just got done with that. I believe it was like, four months, almost. Yes. So then now that, um, I don't have anybody watching over me anymore as much. So when you're in training you have in a senior officer that's there with you and you, they basically instruct you and you get graded every day on how well you do. It's kind of like a report card. It's a scale of one to five about your performance throughout the day. And they talk about how you can improve upon things. And would you do good that day, and stuff like that? Yeah. That so that's a big milestone once you graduate from the academy is becoming you're not a trainee anymore. 

Interviewer  2:52  
Yeah. 

Lauren Del Carlo  2:52  
So now I'm off on my own.

Interviewer  2:53  
Wonderful. Well, congratulations to you. That's exciting. So let's let's take it even further back. I want to know more about now when when you were maybe in middle school or in high school and Did you always know that you wanted to go into law enforcement or criminal justice?

Lauren Del Carlo  3:11  
I knew that I wanted to go into the criminal justice field because I did race get raised in a law enforcement family. My dad actually works for the department as well. He works out of the Fresno area office. So I always knew that I wanted to go into the criminal justice field. I didn't know what exactly you know, I thought maybe law school, maybe FBI, also an officer, I didn't know exactly what agency I wanted to work for. But growing up, I went on ride alongs and I went to the I spent a lot of time in the Fresno area office. Just just seeing what everybody does there. I was always interested in it. And then when I got to college, I majored in at Fresno State, I'm supposed to say I majored in criminology with an emphasis in forensic behavioral science. So I was interested in like, why people do what they do, why people commit crimes and the psychological process in that, and which I found very interesting. And I was actually in the honors program there. So I did, I was able to graduate in four years. Towards the end of my time in college, I started focusing in on more what I wanted to do, career wise. And so I thought about law school, a lot of my professors encouraged me to get my masters to do law school because I had the grades for it. But I just found myself like always being more interested in actually being a police officer and working out in the field. So then, when I was going into my last semester of presses say I applied for the California Highway Patrol and began the hiring process, which lasted me about a year and a half. It is a very long hiring process. So I always recommend to people that if you know this is something you want to get into definitely apply ahead of time because it can be up to two years, sometimes, because it's a very, we're very selective on who we take. And so it's a very long process. I appreciate because you want to make sure that you're picking the best of the best, right? So it takes a while to make sure that people, they do a really thorough background check on people. So it does take a while. So I know that some people get discouraged by that. But I definitely think it's worth it. Because you're going to work for what I mean, I'm a little biased, but I think that we're the best. That's why I chose to work for this department. I kind of went anywhere. I did. My dad told me like, he even discouraged me from just being an officer in general, because he's like, it's dangerous. And that is one of the factors of this job. But I just had a passion for wanting to be an officer 

#UNDERSTANDING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
Interviewer  5:34  
helped me understand I'm still a little bit unclear, I think on the difference in the, in the departments. So when you say different departments. Your department is California Highway Patrol. Correct? Okay, so, go ahead.

Lauren Del Carlo  5:48  
We worked for this, we worked for the state. So you have state agencies, and then you have local agencies. And then you also have I mean, you have to have like sheriff's, so that worked for the whole county. So we worked for the state. So I'm a state employee. So that's what I mean by that. So for us, when you apply to become part of the California Highway Patrol, when if you do get an invitation to the academy, you're going to be going to the one in Sacramento, so we only have one Academy. So what's good about that? Is it standardized training, right? So when I can go anywhere in the state, and that's the beauty of this job. So I can say I want to leave here in Santa Cruz, and I want to be crazy and go to Fresno, for some reason I want to leave the beach, I don't want to go to the President, I can do that I have the flexibility of going anywhere in the state now where if you work for, let's say for Fresno, the Fresno City, you are kind of stuck in Fresno City and you have to laterally transfer. So I think that's one of the high points of working for the CHP is that you can go anywhere in the state is beautiful. You want to go here for a year. You want to go over there, it's up to you. And we also have a lot of specialty positions. Yeah. So you have air ops, you have canine you have capital protection you can work with but the capital, it's like basically the Secret Service for the Capitol if you work for the for the governor. Yeah, the P FBI, Pio. What's PIO, Public Relations Officer. So it's connecting people with through social media, and stuff like that. So there's a bunch of different things that you can do. So that's one of the things if I'm talking about, specifically, like for the California, 

Interviewer  7:29  
You mentioned, that the training is pretty standardized, or you're not pretty it sounds like if it's standardized, it happens at one place, which is great. What's the difference between training of a date officer versus a local city officer?

Lauren Del Carlo  7:45  
So from my understanding, I haven't gone through that program, right. So from what I can say, from what I've seen, and what I've had other people tell me is, let's say if I wanted to go work for Fresno, I'm using President cuz I'm from there, right? I'm from Fresno. So let's say I want to go to work for Fresno PD. So what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to put myself through an academy, and I have to pay for that unless you get sponsors, they don't get that many sponsorships out. So most people what they do, it's like paying for college. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna pay to go through this program, and you're not guaranteed a job afterwards. So you become post certified. And so that's basically saying, it's like the state of California saying, yes, you get a certificate that allows you to be working as an officer in the state of California. So basically, it's not a guarantee position, like I could go there and then have that certificate. But yet I have to have an agency hire me now, if we work for the California Highway Patrol. First of all, when you get the invitation, you're one, if you are fortunate to graduate from the academy, you have a position you will be go to an area office and be an officer there, and you get paid while you're training at the academy. Whereas if you were going to a work if you're going to through the post, the academies, you pay to be there. So not only are you not working, first of all, how do you have time to work, right? Work is you're fully invested in this program. So you're paying money to be there and you don't have time to have another job. That wasn't really appealing to me, because I was like, Well, how am I supposed to afford a place to live? So while you're there, you live there at the CHP Academy five days out of the week, they feed you and plus you're getting paid on top of it to be there. So yeah, so it's definitely it's very, very nice what we have, it's and that's why they are so selected because it's a privilege to go there. Because, you know, they're paying you to be there. They want people that are dedicated, they're gonna make it because they're investing a lot. We invest a lot of money and time and for training for our officers. 

Interviewer  9:53  
Wonderful. Wonderful. That's obviously great to hear. Can you tell me more about you mentioned you use studied criminology with a focus on behavioral forensics

Lauren Del Carlo  10:05  
Yeah, forensic behavior science

Interviewer  10:05  
Thank you forensic behavioral science. So that study that investigates what you know, the motivation why why people do what they do? Can you talk about how or if you've been able to at all, implement any of those studies in your in your training or in what you're doing now.

Lauren Del Carlo  10:26  
so basically, the classes that I took it was psychology of crime, and also value crime. Those are the two that really were specific to my major that stuck out to me, the things that I learned is, there's not always one answer for why somebody does what they do. So you have to take in the totality of the circumstances of why people are doing what they're doing. And you have to take in all the factors of like, their background, where they come from also, biologically, they when we went into the most important parts of developing somebody is when they're actually in the womb. And if you go through traumatic experiences in the womb, that can affect you later on your neurological development. So there's a lot and there's no given like, even when I was working those classes, they people don't have an answer for why people might cry. But it's just helping us basically understand that there's a lot of things that go into it. There's not just like one reason for like, oh, that person did that. Because of this, right? You have to, there's a lot that goes into it. And it's very complex. And that's why there's like a whole field of study, just trying to understand like, why people do what they do. So

#DAY-TO-DAY AS A CHP OFFICER
Interviewer  11:33  
are there this one caught my attention? Are there any examples of what exactly trauma is in the womb? Wow, that's crazy. 

Lauren Del Carlo  11:41  
So things like that could be if the mother is stressed, they can, it can actually the like, the hormones in the body can actually affect the, the baby. And then also if the mother, let's say she is uses alcohol, or drugs that affects the baby, so things like those kinds of yeah, when you're in the womb, 

Interviewer  12:03  
that would have a long lasting effect. Wow. Incredible

Lauren Del Carlo  12:06  
on your development. 

Interviewer  12:08  
So can you tell us more about what it's like to to be out out on the job now? I guess? It's been one week since?

Lauren Del Carlo  12:18  
Yeah, one week since I've been on my own. But I started here at the Santa Cruz ag office in February, okay, sorry, training. So I'm still I basically do everything, but I just have somebody there with me, like helping me along on what to do. But now it's basically, we're actually on in the paired up right now. And because of we're on tactical alert, but normally, I would be on my own on day shift or shift. So that means I'm driving around by myself. Okay. So as an officer, right now, there's a lot of craziness going on in the world. So that can be scary. But I just know that I wouldn't want to do anything else. And I believe that if your heart's always in the right place of what you're doing, then, you know, you're doing what's right for you. So I definitely would still recommend it. I mean, you just have to definitely make sure that you're going into this career for the right reason, 

Interviewer  13:10  
right. So tell us what sorts of of routines Do you have? I'm really just curious about a day in the life I you. You wake up you say I've got to go to work. What what do you how do you prepare for work?

Lauren Del Carlo  13:24  
Well, you got to wake up early to come to work because it actually doesn't start when you get here you have to get here early enough to change and like get all your stuff ready. You have to get your car ready. And then you have briefings so we talk about stuff that's going on we pick our beats, so that's going to be the area so for us that area Santa Cruz County, you're going to be working and yeah, so you basically you answer calls to service. So that can be traffic collisions. That could be helping out the Santa Cruz PD, the sheriff's just like stolen vehicle report stolen vehicle recoveries, riding tickets, it just buries Yeah, you never know what's going to happen. So that's what I was always interested in this job is because you I never wanted to have a job where every day was the same thing. I would, I wouldn't be happy. So that's why today is different.

Interviewer  14:24  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to what to be at KSQD 90.7 FM in Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob Schekman. And our guest today is Officer Del Carlo. Today we're learning about officer doe Carlos journey toward becoming a California Highway Patrol officer in Santa Cruz County. I'm still just trying to figure out more day to day stuff like of course, of course, you can't ever expect anything to be the same every day is in your position and it's so hard for me to even try and put myself in your shoes because I literally I can't Ain't, I can't it's just hard to imagine how hard of a job it is like you said, everything is crazy right now. Especially given the recent tragedy in our area and within the CHP, it's horrible. So how is you said tactical? You guys are on tactical alert?

Lauren Del Carlo  15:20  
That means we're working 12 hour shifts.

Interviewer  15:22  
Okay. Yeah. How was the question be How was it approached? So you working 12 hour shifts? What else? 

Lauren Del Carlo  15:28  
With no days off right now? Oh, my God, we have to have basically as many officers working as possible to have all the resources like all hands on deck kind of right now. Yeah.

Interviewer  15:41  
How many? Do you know what number that is for Santa Cruz County?

Lauren Del Carlo  15:45  
Um, like, What do you mean? Like 

Interviewer  15:48  
how many? Yeah, how many people are active 

Lauren Del Carlo  15:51  
are working right now? Um, so we have to do a car. It's probably like 10 officers working right now. Maybe 10 or 12. And then we also have an overlap shift. So they come in a little bit later. And basically everybody at our office is either working in the morning or the nighttime. Okay. It's been nice to have a partner. 

Interviewer  16:11  
This is this is all of Santa Cruz County?

Lauren Del Carlo  16:14  
Oh, yeah. Yes. Here at the Santa Cruz area office of how many units? How many have working a ship?

Interviewer  16:21  
Okay, so Santa Cruz area. So then I'm down in Watsonville. Does that mean that there's a different Watsonville CHP office?

Lauren Del Carlo  16:28  
So Santa Cruz we so Santa Cruz area office covers all of Santa Cruz County. 

Interviewer  16:32  
Oh, wow.

Lauren Del Carlo  16:34  
The all the unincorporated areas of Santa Cruz County.

Interviewer  16:37  
That's a massive area. 

Lauren Del Carlo  16:40  
Yeah. So I'm beat 15 today. So that means I work up, like highway nine all that area. So everything that is up in the mountains, that's not the 17 State Route. There was a lot of area of there. Yeah. So that's where I'm at today. 

Interviewer  16:57  
what does it mean to be at that area? Are you you're just kind of patrolling up and down Highway. 

Lauren Del Carlo  17:04  
yes. 

Interviewer  17:04  
Okay,

Lauren Del Carlo  17:05  
I'm am to handle all the calls to service in that area. So and then also, I'm going to be driving around that area to basically look for violations. So that's my area. I'm responsible for anything that happens in that area.

Interviewer  17:20  
Are there slow days? Or they're they're busy days? 

we don't like to do...

Okay. Yeah, don't even let's I don't want to do

Lauren Del Carlo  17:28  
There are some days have a higher call volume. 

Interviewer  17:32  
Okay. Yeah, that's, that's a good way to put it. 

Lauren Del Carlo  17:36  
Those days are those days are good days, we get to take a little you get some more do more proactive responses, you get to go look for things rather than just responding from crash to crash to crash.

Interviewer  17:47  
Are there any any calls that you've made, or that you've responded to? That were I want to think of a happy particularly that ended in a positive way. 

I mean, I'm sure a lot of people that have more time on have more calls, but there was one in particular that there was it wasn't necessarily a call, I just saw it. There was a, there's an older model truck on the off ramp. I think it was at Mount Hermon, so off of Highway 17. And I drove by and I saw him out there get like a cone setup behind his truck. And I'm like, What the heck is going on over there? And I like go back, and he's still there. And then I stop. And I'm like, Hey, sir, what's going on? And he told me, he was like, Hey, I'm like, There's something going on with my truck. Like I've been here. He said, for four hours. He had been there for us. And he didn't call anybody. And he's like, Well, I figured you guys were just going to show up here now. So I showed up, but it's four hours later. And so basically, he had already walked all the way to the gas station in Scotts Valley and had walked back to get gas and like he was still having problems with his car. And he was about to go walk back. And he was probably in his 70s Oh, my gosh, so yeah, and it was pretty one day and I was like, sir, you're not walking anywhere else, like, I'm gonna take you to the gas station. So I took him to the gas station. We got him gas, we made sure that his car started out. We didn't need to call a AAA for him. And then we ended up getting him on his way. So that really made it he was like, so he was so thankful that we were there because he would have had to walk all the way back to the gas station again. Yeah, and you know, as dangerous walking around, then, you know, so I that really made me feel good. I think the my favorite part so far has been being able to help people. Because no one else would be there for him if it wasn't for me. So yeah. Oh, good.

Awesome. Wonderful. Is there anything that maybe during the academy or since you since you graduated from the academy, that you've learned about being a California Highway Patrol officer? 

Lauren Del Carlo  19:58  
a lot you learn a lot was breaking is when I think you really learn how to do the job like instills discipline in you, because you wake up at 330 in the morning and go work out until you go eat breakfast, and then you go have a day full of just doing activities, whether that be like shooting at the range, learning stuff in the classroom, you get discipline if you do things wrong. And it's just like, basically, I think that the academy is setting the foundation to have some money, we want people that have good discipline that follow the rules, right? So it's just instilled in that they want to make it hard on you, because they want to make sure that when you come out, new get to your area office that you're not going to quit, right? It's all about also just being an officer, it's all about not giving up, right. Like if you're fighting for your life, like it's always about not giving it. So that's what I think the Academy does, it gives you like a good foundation. But when you get out here, you're learning so much every day, I'm learning so much. And I'm so thankful that I'm at the office where they're very, very supportive of their new officers and answering any questions that we have, because they understand that we're learning, we don't know what we're doing. And it's a it's all learning process. And this job, you never stop learning, you will always come across things every day that you've never come across before.

Interviewer  21:19  
Is there anything that you've learned in your time that was particularly surprising, or just very unexpected?

Lauren Del Carlo  21:25  
I think that collision investigations can be really complex. Sometimes if you have a lot of items that so like physical items of evidence, it actually goes you have to be like, you have to put things on. Like it's called Vizio, which is a program where you basically put out a sketch and a factual diagram of the collision scene. So it's like all the items of evidence, and you have to roll everything out and measure things. So I think that collision investigations are really complex, especially on big collision scenes involving multiple vehicles. And there's a lot of items of evidence. I think that's that's a new by surprise that it's a lot that goes into it. And people probably don't know that. But we do a lot of this plot time that's invested on these traffic collision reports that we write. And there's a lot of report writing, definitely. You got to be here to stay on top of your report writing. It's like, it's like in college, we have a bunch of essays. It's like that

Interviewer  22:24  
is procrastination does not help here. 

Lauren Del Carlo  22:26  
No, no, perhaps there. So stay on top of all this stuff. But it's all about time management, just making sure that when you do have those days where you don't have as many calls, you need to take it upon yourself to say I'm gonna be responsible. 

Interviewer  22:41  
Do you have any specific time management tools that you might recommend to any listeners? 

Lauren Del Carlo  22:46  
Yeah, so just in general, what I've always found is going, I go somewhere, so like, I would come to the office and work on stuff. Just like making sure that you don't put distractions in front of you. Not just where you know, you're gonna get stuff I do stuff at home. I know I'm gonna get distracted. I got my TV. Yeah, I mean bad, I'll probably false. That's why you put yourself like you put yourself okay, I'm gonna sit down and work on this. At least give yourself okay for this amount of time to focus on this and I want to get this much done. So just trying to eliminate distractions with a lot of distractions. You know, you're on your phone, talking. I love to talk so I'm I gotta stop. Trying to like focus, focus. Okay.

Interviewer  23:29  
Sure. Sure. What would you say is a the most common misconception that people have when you tell them you work for the California Highway Patrol?

Lauren Del Carlo  23:40  
I think a lot of people think that we just do, like, take traffic collision reports and write tickets. So it's, I don't think it's true. Like we do a lot of different stuff. And that we are only on the freeway, right? So I'll stop people, like, let's say in the city of Watsonville, I'm driving through I see something, I stopped and they're like, Hey, what are you doing over here? This isn't the freeway. And I'm like, we're everywhere. We that's the beauty of the hydro. We have jurisdiction everywhere. Like we can go anywhere and everywhere. So that's the misconception is that oh, we just write tickets and you have a quota which we don't have a quota. That's untrue people. I have people tell me that. Yeah. So I would say that, that we don't do stuff outside of just staying on the freeway like we have to stay on the freeway. We're not allowed to go anywhere. That's not I go I'm in Santa Cruz County. 

Interviewer  24:27  
Yeah. I think that answers one of my own misconceptions. Not that not that I'm ever pulled over or anything like that. But I have surely heard. Yeah, I've surely heard people say oh, the CHP can get you in the city. Don't worry. So now you know, folks.

Lauren Del Carlo  24:46  
Yes, we're everywhere. Yeah, let's but we don't do take calls in the city. That's where we might be they see that we our calls are going to be on the areas we handled. Like I said, the unincorporated areas so yeah, that's we won't be in the city usually, but we might have I'd be driving through there and you might see us and we can definitely, if we see something, we can still stop it. And there's nothing that says we can't

#ADVICE FOR ASPIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
Interviewer  25:07  
right, awesome. Yeah. Now what? What sorts of specific skills, skills hard or soft skills do you think you you've built upon, and that you would suggest others try and strengthen if they want to sort of follow your path. 

Lauren Del Carlo  25:22  
So I think I definitely encourage people, if possible to go to college, take that time for yourself. And if people want to jump right into it, as soon as they graduate high school, I think take that time to go to college. It kind of teaches you time management, because you have you have responsibilities, right, you have to study for this test, you have to write this report. And definitely it gives you that time to mature because you have, it's a long career, right? So you're in this for the long haul. So I want to say like, I know that people are excited to get out there and become an officer. But if possible, even if it's going into community college, like take that time to just go through and get some more schooling because we also have incentives for that we have educational, the I get paid extra for having a bachelor's, wow. And if you have your AAA, you have also a pay increase as well. So that's an incentive to so I definitely recommend that it has a good foundation. And then if you are preparing to go to a police academy, let's say not even a hydrogeologist any definitely, physical agility is very important. So taking care of yourself, make sure you're eating right. It's a lot of running and just like push ups, sit ups, jumping jacks is for workouts. That's what I always tell people, that's what you're going to be doing at any police academy, pretty much. Just that Yeah, cuz you we have tests at the Academy too. So like written tests. So I said that also college can prepare you for that to be successful?

Interviewer  26:50  
And how, how have you built upon? And how would you suggest others do interpersonal skills? Right, when you have to interact with someone? What, what needs to be strong there?

Lauren Del Carlo  27:03  
Yeah, what I recommend I was a server for five years, right? So I remember when I first started out, I was a hostess. And so I also recommend having a job that works in the service industry, right? Because I mean, I'm still in the service industry. I'm a public servant, right? I provide a service to the people of California. So I recommend working in the service industry. So as a server, I learned how to talk to people, right? So I would go to their table. I don't know who this person is, I don't know anything about it. I tried my small talk with them. And then you want to leave people like happy customers that come back, right. So I definitely recommend having a job that works in customer service, because it teaches you patience, because you're dealing with people from all walks of life, right. And so it definitely taught me patience, because patience is something you need to definitely have on this job. Right. And we're expecting professional no matter what. 

Interviewer  27:53  
Yeah. All right, we're, we are coming down to our last couple of minutes here. Do you have any advice for our listeners, for students, anyone who thinks they might want to be going down the career path in law enforcement,
