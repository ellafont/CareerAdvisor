Andrea Mollenauer  1:00  
Hi! 

Interviewer  1:00  
Thank you very much for taking the time to do this interview with me.

Andrea Mollenauer  1:04  
I'm glad to do so.
 
# BACKGROUND

Interviewer  1:05  
Awesome. I really appreciate it. And Andrea, do you mind telling us about some of your background? 

Andrea Mollenauer  1:10  
Sure. Well, you mentioned that I'm a chef instructor at Cabrillo, I've been at Cabrillo for just under a year. But I've been a culinary instructor for about 14 years. And I'm teaching everything from high school culinary programs to summer youth camps to corporate team building and kind of everything in between. And I also own a catering company. And I have an event venue in downtown Santa Cruz called the food lounge. So I'm fully immersed in the Santa Cruz food scene and love to inspire and educate people through food. So that's that's me. 

Interviewer  1:46  
Very cool. And so you said you have been a chef for 14 years? 

Andrea Mollenauer  1:50  
Well, I've been a chef for many more years than that. I graduated the culinary program at Cabrillo back in the early 2000s. So about 20 years ago, I was becoming a chef in the program myself and went off and did my thing as a caterer. I have had a catering business for 16 years now. Started teaching slowly here and there. And then now I would say that teaching is my primary job rather than my catering. 

Interviewer  2:19  
Okay, and you shared with me before the interview that you recently got hired full time at Cabrillo. 

Andrea Mollenauer  2:24  
I did how exciting it kind of feels full circle for me and I just really love the program. So I'm glad to be a part of growing it now.

Interviewer  2:33  
Congratulations on that. And I think it's great that they have you as an instructor as a grad of the program. Do you mind telling our listeners more about the program?

#CABRILLO'S CULINARY PROGRAM

Andrea Mollenauer  2:41  
Oh sure. So the culinary arts program that Cabrillo offers everything from foundational culinary instruction in the form of its beginning courses, both lecture based and lab based all the way up to advanced kind of restaurant style service. And, you know, there's also there's also a baking department, there's also a wine section. And so you can get a variety of different certificates and associate's degrees. And there's what I like about it myself compared to other programs in the region is, I love that it has a hands on opportunities for the students because we also run labs that actually provide food to the public. So a little bit different during the pandemic situation right now. But typically, we have a beginning lunch restaurant and an advanced dinner restaurant and a full catering program that caters parties and events. You know a lot of weddings, at the historic Sesnon house on campus at Cabrillo. And right now we still are operating some select courses on campus with kind of like a rigorous protocol for safety. But we were still doing some on campus courses. And so we're doing takeout for people to come and pick up our food instead of the restaurant since the restaurant at this time is not considered safe. 

Interviewer  4:01  
Okay. And I was gonna ask also what makes the Sesnon house historic? 

Andrea Mollenauer  4:05  
Well, let's see. I let me brush up on my history here. So it was a home owned by the Porter Sesnons who are a family and I don't remember exactly what they did but I believe that at one time this was their their vacation home. And then over time it was land that was gifted. I'm really not that brushed up on my history about the Sesnon house, I apologize. Even though all of my catering events are essentially held at this beautiful location and there's like these beautiful historic pictures on the walls but it's been around since the 1800s. So we kind of keep the integrity of the house we keep we maintain it in a historic fashion and we tell the the customers the brides essentially that they can you know they can utilize certain spaces that have to like respect or not utilize other spaces like there's this big beautiful pagoda outside on the sprawling lawn and that one no one's allowed to like climb up on it and take photograph laughs even though it would make some stunning pictures. It's the reason why people are attracted to the space for their parties and events. Because it's both indoor and outdoor. It's this beautiful historic building. And it has a lovely history from, you know, Santa Cruz and Bay Area families.

Interviewer  5:16  
That's awesome. And it is sure a beautiful building. And what I was trying to say before is that it's so great that you guys have that for your students to be able to provide food to the public and to really get their feedback on what they're up to in the kitchen. 

Andrea Mollenauer  5:29  
It is, you know, our program wasn't always at assessment house, it used to be primarily on upper campus where our bakery is, the 900 building. But for a long time now, most of its been housed in the Sesnon house. We have a lovely commercial kitchen in the back and people can come and dine in the dining room for lunch and dinner, have events on the patio or in the grass, like for evening and weekend events. It's really fun to work there. You know, I like looking, walking by the pictures on the walls and telling the students a little bit about the history and just really respecting the space.

Interviewer  6:01  
That's cool. And you talked about that the grads of the program get certificates and with those certificates, does that put the students or the grads in a good position to land jobs in the kitchen out there.

Andrea Mollenauer  6:13  
I like to think so. A degree in anything doesn't guarantee you a job. However, in a really competitive industry like food and culinary where people can climb that ladder within a restaurant from busser or dishwasher all the way up to prep cook and sous chef, I would say that a degree from a program like Cabrillo could, for example, give them a little bit of a leg up a little bit. Perhaps if more practice technique, I think it's also going to depend heavily on the student and the students commitment to a really hard industry like culinary arts. And if it's right for them, I think a degree is a really great way to kind of jumpstart that pathway for them, it's often going to be that people need to start low in an organization like a restaurant and build their way up and show what you know, show what they know and practice technique based on what that restaurant specializes in. But it's really creating a foundation for them with the certificate or the degree you know, the all of the foundational work that we practice in the program is kind of like the building blocks for them, in my opinion.


# HOW THE PROGRAM IS CHANGING WITH COVID 

Interviewer  7:22  
Okay, thank you, Andrea, we were talking about that the program is still it's running in person right now. And that must be a little bit of a challenge with everything going on, would you mind sharing with us how the program is adapting to the changes.

Andrea Mollenauer  7:35  
So from what I understand at the college, any program that wants to run person in person courses, they're called difficult to convert, they would be difficult to hold via zoom. And you can probably imagine that like teaching knife skills and you know, tasting students food, and it would be really hard to do via zoom in a distance education format. So the college allows us to submit plans and proposals about how we're going to do it safely. And just because we've planned it all out doesn't mean that it isn't still stressful. And so we've been approved to be on campus with strict protocol and health checks and all of the required safety protocol to try to keep the students and the teachers and the campus and all of the, you know, maintenance workers safe that are around campus. But it's still super stressful every day because we're wearing you know, in my case, like double masks for hours and hours on end. And in that case, like I forget to drink water all day because I don't want to slip my mask off. And, you know, we're watching to make sure that the students as they're having fun in the kitchen and working hard and practicing their skill that they're still maintaining safe social distance and keeping you know all of those protocols in the front of their mind, not in the back of their mind. And so it does become a little bit more of a stressful situation. But ultimately, I'm glad that the students still want to learn so I'm doing everything I can to keep it safe for them and still be on campus.

Interviewer  9:00  
okay, and do require the students to periodically get corona tests of any kinds and do you know if students are going to be required to be vaccinated when those become available?

Andrea Mollenauer  9:12  
The college is not requiring that the students that are on campus get Coronavirus tests however, we are taking daily and so that means if they're coming into a class every single time they arrive on campus for that class, they're getting a temperature check and being asked a series of questions by the instructor like have you had any symptoms related to COVID in the last 24 hours in the last couple of days unless you had an exposure to people you know who tested positive we have a slew of questions that we asked every student every time so we call them health checks and although this college is not requiring Coronavirus tests if anyone doesn't pass the health check in the morning before coming into the class then they're referred to the Student Health Services nurse and then they have a conversation and kind of talk about it. The potential symptoms and potential exposures and then they go from there in a confidential way with the student health nurse. And I don't know actually about any vaccination requirements coming up through the pipeline with regards to Santa Cruz County Schools. I know that some schools require like young vaccinations like the young student vaccinations before you can register students for like preschool and stuff. I don't know if Santa Cruz county or the state of California are gonna require anything like that related to Coronavirus vaccinations that to be determined.

Interviewer  10:31  
For sure. I was wondering, so we're coming up on about a year of since we all went to zoom or a lot of us want to zoom. Since you guys are able to teach in person have you had to send anyone home because of like, their fever, maybe like when you do that initial check?

Andrea Mollenauer  10:47  
Frequently. Yes, we have sent students home. And what we do is we refer them up to the Student Health Services and we send an email and shoot a phone call over to the person in charge of their meeting, we want to be safe, we want to make sure that even if it's just like seasonal allergies, if it's something new or different that the student hasn't been experienced. And the teachers too and the instructors as well, not just the students, if it's something new or different that the person has hasn't been experiencing in the past that might be a potential like respiratory COVID symptom, then we would rather be safe than sorry. And we have referred some students to health services and not allowed them into the course at the beginning of class time. And typically, they're cleared. Sometimes they're tested and have to wait for their test results. And then they're cleared. And sometimes they have to go home and quarantine and so it really just depends, but I feel like our system is generally working. I hope I'm not jinxing us, we're trying really hard to be rigorous. But I feel like we have a system that potentially could work if the students and instructors are also being safe outside of school.

Interviewer  11:52  
Yeah. And it seems like it's working so far, and that you guys are doing the best that you can to make it stay that way. So good job. And I would imagine that your duties and responsibilities have changed, maybe somewhat and, and I know some of this, we were talking about before the interview that you're making some like construction videos that will just serve as like foundation material for your class going forward, which I think is great. 

Andrea Mollenauer  12:14  
Yeah all my classes actually and teaching in the high school setting as well. And the high school culinary program that I teach is all online, none of it has come back to in person education. And so a lot of the slide decks and the instructional videos and all of the photo documents that I'm putting together for the students I feel like are going to be really great resources that I can use in the future, even if we do come back in person, and they can refer to them at home and they're practicing their knife skills at home or, you know, I can use them to send out as pre learning materials. So they can be like a little bit up on the material before coming into class and practicing the techniques. So I'm just loving putting together all of the new educational material. It's a lot of work. Like I'm not gonna lie, I think you said it earlier. It's a stress on teachers as well, that is unprecedented. But I'm actually really loving the results. Like the results are that I'm coming up with tons of other ways of teaching what I've been teaching for many, many years, and I'm coming up with a ton of foundational material in a ways that I never would have had time or made the time to do before. And so I think that when all this is said and done, it sounds crazy, but it's going to make me a better teacher. And so there is a small nugget of positivity here.

Interviewer  13:36  
Yes, silver linings are definitely welcome. And it's great to hear.

Andrea Mollenauer  13:40  
My friends all call me like the eternal optimist. And me, you might as well like in the middle of the pandemic, like what is there to be thankful for? And what can I do to grow my program and my teaching style. And so here we are.

Interviewer  13:53  
It's great to have that perspective. And one thing we were talking about is the students can share videos and show you pictures, but that doesn't mean you know how it tastes. 

Andrea Mollenauer  14:03  
The hardest part, I can't taste any other foods. Some of it looks so good. And I can't even taste it. If I wanted to
  
 # MOST MEMORABLE PROJECTS

Interviewer  14:10  
Andre, do you mind sharing some of your most memorable projects that you've been involved with with your long career as a chef?

Andrea Mollenauer  14:17  
Well, I would say I don't know if this is a project but one of my most exciting recent occurrences was just getting hired and you know, trusted to be an instructor at Cabrillo in the culinary department when I was originally you know, a graduate of the program. I feel like that's just like my full circle moment where I'm just so excited to be there. So that to me feels like you know, a testament to some of the education and food stuff that I've done over the years and I love to put students in the forefront of what we're doing. You know, like it may not be their first place like going out and being in front of the public but I've found opportunities over the years to show them how to be good caterers by finding events that we can cater in the community and doing like Chef versus chef challenges where the students all came up with different recipes. And we had this big event is big fundraiser where the public was invited to come and test and taste and grade all of their work. And it was like this fun competition between them. And I think that the ways in which I've taken the teaching out of the classroom has been some of my biggest highlights. Over the years as a food educator, I've loved all of the programs, the luncheons, the caterings. And the times when the students are given props by the community for like feeding them and providing really good food, it just puts a huge smile on their face. And it makes their learning like meaningful, I guess.

Interviewer  15:40  
That's really cool. So I'd imagine that their homework isn't just going home and watching Top Chef or something.

Andrea Mollenauer  15:47  
They still like to do that. And their homework is usually going home and figuring out what they can cook in the kitchen, or her how they're going to market that new product idea, and so on and so forth.

# EXPERIENCE WITH THE HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAM

Interviewer  15:58  
So, do you mind telling our students who are listening more about what you do with high schools?

Andrea Mollenauer  16:04  
Sure. So I started with high schools. When I was just graduating the program, one of my instructors, one of my instructors and mentors said, Hey, there's this, there's this private high school in Santa Cruz County that is looking for a summer culinary instructor. And I think you'd fit the you know, the bill. And so I started teaching. And over the years, my teaching ability developed into kind of growing an entire high school culinary program for the County Office of Education. And that culinary program is offered to all of the County high school students, they have to register with their career and technical education counselor on campus. And then my particular program, this isn't the same in all communities, but my particular program, they come to me so I own a kitchen. And the students would come after school, they'd come off campus to my kitchen, and they would work in a professional kitchen environment. And so that culinary arts program was kind of a starting way to kind of explore if they liked food enough to make a career out of it. And you know, some of the students and actually many of the students that took my high school classes were not there for career purposes, or they realized really quickly like, well, this is not for me, but they left with this really great foundation of how to feed themselves and how to cook for themselves. And so that program actually transfers units or what we call articulates to a Cabrillo introductory course if they if they choose to come to Cabrillo culinary and use those transfer units or it's just a really great foundational course where they can learn like how to boil water and how to go off to college and not starve and a little bit more about food and sustainable agriculture and and the food world before they go off and become young foodies themselves.

Interviewer  17:52  
Okay, and is it is it expensive to enroll in the program.

Andrea Mollenauer  17:56  
The high school culinary program is not expensive at all. It's offered through their high school as part of an elective unit and we ask for a materials contribution which is a donation any student or parents who can't afford it, then they're not refused. They're just accepted and we find funding through the county and so that one's super cheap. You just got to register at school like you're taking an elective course next semester. But then the culinary program at Cabrillo it's kind of like all the normal, you know, Cabrillo unit pricing as if you were registering for any other course at Cabrillo. And some of the additional costs such as acquiring a uniform or a knife kit are actually often covered. There's a very recent grant that was just granted to the culinary arts students that is covering all of their beginning costs of materials, uniforms and textbooks. And so although it's a program that some people think might be a little bit more pricey than like a normal math class, it really isn't now that we've received some really strong community supported grants and the students can come to Cabrillo culinary for just the same price as taking other unit courses at Cabrillo.

Interviewer  19:10  
Okay, that's great to hear that it's still available and affordable.

Andrea Mollenauer  19:14  
Well if you think about the, sorry to interrupt, but if you think about like what people think of a culinary academy, you know, the private culinary schools are $20000 or $40,000 for a certificate and at Cabrillo, you know, we have a really strong program without all of those those outrageous fees. So I think that's pretty cool.

# MONTREAL VERSUS SANTA CRUZ

Interviewer  19:33  
Yeah, me too. And I was wondering because you shared with us that you are Canadian, and that you moved from the East Coast and you moved out here out west to Santa Cruz. How does our food stuck up in your eyes as a chef?

Andrea Mollenauer  19:48  
Well, let's say that I moved here 20 years ago and my knowledge of food and the food scene in Montreal where I grew up was not as enthusiastic when I was, you know, in my mid to late teens and so I moved here and became a real foodie like, this is where my food passion grew, you know, my life in Santa Cruz and California. I've been here a long time. And so I would say Montreal is known for being very European and very food forward and very exciting. When it comes to the food scene, I go back and visit and really get to enjoy it almost as a tourist these days, even though I still have family there. But like, I go back with tourist eyes, you know, like, show me, you know, what do you got, but Santa Cruz is really where I grew my food passion. And so I'm gonna say they're very different in my eyes. Okay.

Interviewer  20:42  
And Montreal is pretty, I would imagine it's probably pretty French influenced? Yes. Yeah, very much. So. Any restaurants that you could recommend to our listeners?

Andrea Mollenauer  20:52  
 In Santa Cruz? 

Interviewer  20:53  
Yeah.

Andrea Mollenauer  20:54  
Oh, wow. I guess it depends what they're looking for. And not everything is open in full capacity right now. But a lot of restaurants are still thriving. I drove by a restaurant that I like very much, even though I haven't been there in a long time because I won't go out during the pandemic. To sit at a restaurant I'll go out to dine tait like to get takeout and take home. But Oswald's was packed the other day when I drove by all their outdoor dining was full. And so I imagine they're still doing well. And I like I like their food, their burgers are great. 

Interviewer  21:26  
I agree. 

Andrea Mollenauer  21:27  
At the bar, and I'm really into popups right now, I meant to people taking their ideas and and trying them out in a pop up scenario. And you know, I'm a little bit partial to some of the pop ups that are growing their businesses within my kitchen at the food lounge downtown. There's some great food coming out of fullsteam dumpling. They do ramen, they do dumplings, everything made from scratch by hand. The dough is the fillings and their popups around town at farmer's markets and some takeaway on Wednesdays from the food Lounge is really good, really good. And he plays with the menu and the seasonality. And I mean, speaking of burgers, we put out an amazing burger. I don't know why I'm talking about burgers so much. Maybe I'm hungry. But we put out an amazing burger at the at the Palo Alto restaurant, we were taking pictures of our food before the restaurant opens next week, for the spring semester for our takeout service. And oh my gosh, the pictures of our burger. And our hot chicken sandwich looks so good. I would say, you know, try the takeout at all the restaurants in your local community, like just Just try them. Because if they're still open, and they're still wanting to feed you, they might be struggling compared to in dining. But a lot of the food is still coming out really good. And I see a lot on Instagram, and the food still looks great, you know, cardboard box or not? 

# RESTURANTS STRUGGLINGS

Interviewer  22:51  
Yeah and they could definitely use the community's support in these times.

Andrea Mollenauer  22:55  
They can, I know restaurants are struggling so much. And I'm so grateful to be in the education part of the food business right now. And you know, just inspiring students to think differently about like, what's next in the food industry. But restaurants and all my restaurant colleagues are having a little bit of a hard time right now. 

Interviewer  23:12  
Yeah and I agree with you on the on the great pop ups that have that are available to us. I mean, just the quality of food that you can get out of pop up is it's incredible, just as good as a restaurant really. And it's fun. It's like little it's a different type of experience. Getting to like the know the people who work there and you develop a relationship or you want to support them and, and their food's great too often. And also you mentioned Oswald's and what a great restaurant that is. I remember the first time I went there was, I don't know if you went to their previous location? It was really cool.

Andrea Mollenauer  23:43  
I did many years ago. Oh my gosh, I did.

Interviewer  23:46  
I had an old girlfriend who took me there and she dared me, she ordered the sweet breads. And I was like my first experience with that there would you mind telling us what the listeners what sweet breads are?

Andrea Mollenauer  23:58  
Yeah, so if you like to eat all sorts of animal parts, sweet breads are not as they sound, so they sound so pretty, don't they? But basically, calling is basically a culinary name for an innard. Like, I think it's like the thymus gland or something like that, if I'm not mistaken sweetbreads sounds so innocent, but they're actually one of those things like pulling out all of the gizzards and guts from the turkey right? Like you got to get to know all of the parts like the brain and the sweet breads and the gizzard and, and, and the heart and the liver. And that's what a sweet bread is. It's usually at higher end restaurants, they use fully total utilization of product, they use every part of the animal and so it's not something you'd necessarily see at your at your local, you know, fast food joiny but probably something you'd see it as well. 

Interviewer  24:51  
And I think that it's one of those things that hearing about or talking about it it might turn people off to it but if they didn't know what it was and they tried to It could very well like it.

# ADVICE 

Andrea Mollenauer  25:01  
Yeah, absolutely. You know, like, if you my mom used to cook me liver growing up and you know, most people won't eat liver and don't save all that from, you know, buying a whole bird or whole turkey or whatever. But if you cook liver correctly, and you saute some onions, and you throw that on there too, and you don't overcook it, it's actually quite delicious and very healthy. So I mean, part of that culinary education, I like to say, is just being super adventurous. And I tell my students like my rule is you got to taste everything twice, because the first time maybe it just wasn't done properly. Maybe the person you had it by just didn't understand the cooking process. And if you try it again, you might be surprised.


Interviewer  25:42  
Yeah, I think that's great advice. And speaking of advice, what advice or resources can you give the students who are interested in pursuing a career as a chef,

Andrea Mollenauer  25:51  
I think a combination of education make a practice learning from you know, an instructor or a mentor, combined with really hard work is, is what I highly recommend. As a chef, there's no way you're going to get a good culinary education, walk out the door and be given, you know, a high price salary and a chef position your name on the building, I believe that a combination of learning through different methods like a culinary program, and lots of practice and play at home and and then you know, maybe an internship combined with just really hard work. The culinary industry is one of the hardest industries to be in both physically and technically and emotionally. And so I'd say that people who plug through in the industry and are willing to learn every day from in different ways, are the ones who are going to succeed in this in this industry. And that's my advice for the perfect combination of success is continued education about food and all the different new food techniques and combined with hard work.

# CLOSING

Interviewer  26:59  
Okay, I think that's really great advice. And, Andrea, is there any last things you'd like to leave our listeners with?

Andrea Mollenauer  27:00  
I think that's advice in many industries. I don't think there's any magic certificate or magic way or, you know, like secret to getting into something. It's just like, learn learn, learn work, work, work.

Interviewer  27:18  
Yeah. dedication and hard work go a long ways. I think. 

Andrea Mollenauer  27:21  
I agree. 

Interviewer  27:22  
Anything you'd like to add?

Andrea Mollenauer  27:23  
Oh, have fun with food, everybody. That's my most favorite thing to to challenge people with. It's just like, see something at the supermarket you've never tried before. Grab it. Try a new way of cooking something that is familiar to you or always say yes, and try things at least twice. That's my challenge to all of our listeners play with food and be adventurous.
