# INTRODUCTION
Interviewer  0:16  
Hello and welcome everyone to KSQD de Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and you're listening to our show What To Be where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What To Be is a program provided by Your Future Is Our Business, a Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, panels, and other work based learning activities. Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of Natural Bridges media, or Your Future Is Our Business. The information provided during this program does not reflect its career in its entirety. Today, I had the pleasure to speak to Christina Ortega, who's an academic counselor at Cabrillo College. Hi, Christina.


Christina Ortega  1:00  
Hi, Patrick. Thanks for having me today.


Interviewer  1:02  
Thank you very much for taking your time to come down to the station. I really appreciate you being here. 


Christina Ortega  1:06  
Thanks.


# CAREER JOURNEY
Interviewer  1:08
Awesome. Would you please describe your career journey for us? 


Christina Ortega  1:10  
Yeah, so currently, I am an academic counselor at Cabrillo College, and I also am one of the transfer coordinators. Before that I was an advisor at UCSC, and before that, I was an evaluator admissions and records at Cabrillo as wel. And before that I graduated from Fresno State.


Interviewer  1:30  
Awesome. So how long have you been working in your current career?


Christina Ortega  1:35  
I've been a counselor at Cabrillo for about seven years as a full time counselor.


Interviewer   1:39  
Awesome. And then how were you at UCSC?


Christina Ortega  1:43  
Yeah, so about three years at UCSS prior to that.


Interviewer  1:47  
Okay. What are the big differences between working for those two different schools.


Christina Ortega  1:53  
So UCSC I had about 1200 students as an advisor for one of their largest majors. Students knew what they wanted to be, they knew they were at UCSC, and they wanted to graduate from UCSC. At Cabrillo, it's very different. They're not sure what their major is. They're going to multiple universities. So it's more guidance, I would say at Cabrillo and I would say my caseload is a lot smaller at Cabrillo. So I do have that opportunity to give that one on one attention to my students.


Interviewer  2:25  
Yeah, that's great. And when you have you said 1200 students when you're at UCSC, that's a lot.


Christina Ortega  2:29  
Yeah, that was definitely a big load but it was one of the largest majors,


Interviewer  2:33  
And then at Cabrillo how many students would you say you average have?


Christina Ortega  2:39  
I would say it's probably 300 to 400. I work primarily with STEM students up in the STEM Center, which is one of our support resources at Cabrillo. So having dedicated STEM counselor I get to know my students very well and know what their career aspirations are and really help them through the path at Cabrillo.


# JOB AT CABRILLO
Interviewer 2:59  
Do you like that part of the job a little bit more?


Christina Ortega  3:03  
I love it to be able to know students by name and know where they're transferring know what's on their plate, their struggles, what they're having difficulty in, you really have an opportunity to guide them and help them they're not just a number, they're actually a person and you get to they know me by name, they know where to find me. And you become one of their support teams to get them through this academic journey. 


Interviewer  3:28  
Yeah, and it can definitely be confusing. At Cabrillo, I think there's a lot of people who come back to school. So it could all be very foreign to them and confusing to figure out how to make it work. Right?


Christina Ortega  3:41  
Yeah, I would agree things are constantly changing requirements are constantly changing the tools we use, especially through COVID having to use Canvas and zoom. If it was a returning student, it's all very foreign to them. So we make sure that we guide them and we make sure that we have so many support resources at Cabrillo to help them through this transition. 


Interviewer  4:03  
Yeah, I definitely found that to be true for myself. And Cabrillo is just full of amazing people who you get the sense that they genuinely care about you succeeding. It feels really good. Like for me not being at a school for a long time, and I felt loved and it's very motivating to like oh yeah, I can do this, and like other people believe in me too. And they are really nice.


Christina Ortega  4:23  
That's so good to hear.


# EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY
Interviewer  4:25  
Absolutely. I was gonna ask you, do you want to talk about your education journey?


Christina Ortega  4:32  
I am a first generation college student, I was the first of my family to go to higher education. I didn't really have an option. I didn't know what community college was. I didn't know the different opportunities that I would have had. It was just go to a four year and this is what you're gonna study. 


I was a business major because that's what my family suggested that I'd be really good at. And I found myself really unhappy and unsatisfied with my courses. As I went to Fresno State right out of high school, lived in the dorms, and majored in business. And for the first time, I was not doing well in my classes because I was really unhappy with them. So as the true academic counselor, I looked through the catalog and looked for things that you know, started to look a little bit interesting and took electives that I may enjoy. And I decided to major in psychology. 


As I was going through my psychology coursework, I thought, you know, what do I but there's so many opportunities to do with psychology, you don't necessarily have to be a psychologist. You're just learning how people think and how people interact with each other, so I got a part time job as like a peer advisor at Fresno State and I absolutely fell in love with it. And I knew that's what I wanted to study. 


So then right after I graduated, my BA in psychology, I went on to get my Master's in Counseling. At that time, I thought I wanted to be a K through 12 Counselor. So I did all the coursework required to be a K through 12 counselor. I did my internship at a high school and a junior high, but my heart was in higher education and helping first generation students navigate higher education. 


And so then I applied at Cabrillo, I was an evaluator. So basically I take incoming transcripts and I tell them what they mean for Cabrillo or what that means for transfer. And then shortly after that, I got hired at UCSC as a psychology advisor. But I knew that my heart was at the community college. So I'm very thankful that I had the opportunity to get hired on full time and make my way back to Cabrillo.


Interviewer  6:37  
Well, congratulations for that. And also for being the first in your family to graduate school and doing what you do. That's really awesome. Do you think that you felt kind of like a sense of wanting to give back because you've maybe have counselors that helped guide you?


Christina Ortega  6:52  
Yes, I definitely attribute to my high school counselor that helped guide me, but also, I wish I would have had me when I was in college; maybe it wouldn't have taken me so long. Or maybe someone would have sat down and said, “Wait, you're not doing well in these classes? What's going on here? Let's talk about it.” And so I think that's really where my heart is to help first generation students really find their path, but be that mentor because they don't have that at home. So I could be that person for them. 


# MEETING WITH COUNSELOR AT CABRILLO
Interviewer  7:20  
That's great. And I know Cabrillo, at least, when I was there recently, when you made an appointment to see a counselor was a different counselor every time. But I found one that seemed very kind and seemed to want to help me or whatever. So I just would reach out to that person. They said, “Oh, yeah, you can just email me directly,” and that was awesome. 


Christina Ortega  7:39  
Yeah, shout out to Lauren Cole. She's a great friend of mine. But yeah, so we do encourage and facilitate that relationship where students continue to meet with the same counselor so they don't have to start their story all over again, because becomes frustrating, I would not want to go see a doctor, a new doctor every single time I always going to the doctor. You want to be able to build that rapport with that student and not and start your story all over again, and really build that connection with your counselor. So we do encourage students to meet with their same counselor if it's a good fit. 


Interviewer  8:11  
And it also seems to help create, a comprehensive education plan for me. And we would talk about the classes and when it made sense to like to take them and so it didn't seem overwhelming. And then you can see your path. Yeah, totally. Yeah, motivating and it seems like then it's linear or whatever you're like, “Okay, I can see where I'm going.”


Christina Ortega  8:29  
Yeah, and it doesn't feel so daunting, right? Because you look at the requirements you have 60 units to transfer and you have all of your GE but if you see it lay down and path and you're working with your talent counselor saying you know I have this to do this semester, I have all these other responsibilities, we can help balance that out. So that's one of our one of our tricks of the trade.


Interviewer  8:49  
So have you did you start meeting students in person?


Christina Ortega  8:54  
Yes, we're back in person. We have in person drop in and we have in person appointment. So and then fall semester, we'll have even more. So getting back to some type of normalcy. We are noticing that students really liked the zoom option, though. They do like to be able to zoom in from their home or on their lunch break and have that flexibility. So we're definitely gonna be keeping a lot of our virtual services as well. 


Interviewer  9:18  
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. I've done plenty of counseling or met plenty of counselors on my phone. Yeah, super convenient. Yeah. On the beach walk like, Oh, stop. I'm a counseling appointment. It works great.


Christina Ortega  9:26  
Yeah, exactly. You don't have to worry about the traffic. 


Interviewer  9:29  
Yeah. Are you able to see as many people in person vs online?


Christina Ortega  9:34  
I would say we were able to assist more online just because students have that flexibility just to pop in whenever they can. So it is a lot more accessible for our students. We do have the students that want that in person opportunity, so we're able to meet them wherever they're at. 


# CHALLENGES WITH ZOOM
Interviewer  9:50  
That's great to have the option of going online or in person. Was it difficult when things did switch to zoom for you?


Christina Ortega  9:57  
Definitely part of being a counselor is noticing the non verbal cues? If a student's in distress or student is not keeping up their hygiene, or they're getting water in their eyes when they're talking about a class. When they don't turn on their camera or you're on a phone call you can't notice those nonverbal cues, and that's really, really important. So that has been difficult. 


Also, I'm a counselor, I love being around people I love that's what gives me energy. And not having that human connection with my students I definitely have missed. There are students that have graduated the past two years, and I've never met in person I met for the first time at graduation. We both had tears in her eyes because we had this relationship, but it was just on video, or I didn't even know what some of them looked like. They’re like, “Christina, it's me”. And I'm like, “Who are you?” So it's definitely I'm really excited to go back in person and teach in person and just be back in the classroom and in the office with the students.


Interviewer  11:00  
I think a lot of people and students struggled over the past couple years, and if you notice that someone might have been struggling, if their hygiene was poor, or whatever. I mean, when people open up to you would you help direct them towards resources.


Christina Ortega  11:17  
We definitely have so many resources at Cabrillo. But we,, if someone's fidgeting, or they're crying, you'd be like, are you talking to someone, we direct them to our Student Health Services, or we have a retention coordinator that can help them with wellness kits. So it is very important to be able to see students and make sure they don't, sometimes they don't know what they need. To be able to connect them and be that warm handoff is really important in my role.


# SUMMER EXPERIENCE 
Interviewer  11:43  
Absolutely, and what's your summer look like with your job?


Christina Ortega  11:48  
Most counselors take the summer off. We are faculty, so we're on a 10 month contract. But for me and transfer, I am getting ready for the next academic term, coordinating the TAG, and our transfer reps and getting our presentations ready. We also need to provide summer counseling because students are needing to get into classes for fall. So it's been quite busy. I did work a lot over the summer.


Interviewer  12:11  
Not to mention also summer classes, right?


Christina Ortega  12:15  
Yes, we have summer school, and we just ended our last session. But yeah, summer is one of our busiest times because students are transferring to Cabrillo. They're getting ready to transfer. We have freshmen coming in that need classes and they need them now.


Interviewer  12:32  
You were sharing with me before the interview that it's super busy time for you right now with school starting?


Christina Ortega  12:37  
Yeah, right. Definitely ramping up. I feel like as we get closer to the semester starting students are realizing, “Oh, I didn't register, or I do need classes, or I woke up and changed my major. And I need a whole different set of classes.”


Interviewer 12:52
So that can be super stressful. 


Christina Ortega  12:55
Yeah. And it's stressful for them, but we have a great team that are helping them through it.


Interviewer  12:57  
Yeah. And it could be stressful for you too I’d imagine.


Christina Ortega  12:59  
Oh, yes.


# SELF CARE
Interviewer  13:01  
Have you developed any self care practices to keep you know your energy?


Christina Ortega  13:06  
Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying to be better about it, but definitely disconnecting once the day is over. When you're in six to seven Zoom meetings a day, it can be very daunting, so just stepping away from the computer. I go to Hot Yoga, I have great workout partners, I take my dog for lots of walks. Just really making sure I'm taking care of myself because if I don't take care of myself I can't take care of them.


# CONNECTING WITH STUDENTS
Interviewer  13:29  
Do you want to talk about some of the skills you use in your job?


Christina Ortega  13:33  
Definitely being a good listener, having a lot of empathy, organizational skills, critical thinking skills. I think most importantly, being really open-minded and being able to listen to what the student is saying, and not assuming what they're thinking. Being very patient with them, also, because it is they're often changing their major or deciding they want to do something else, and to really put yourself in their shoes and have that open and empathetic heart is most important.


Interviewer  14:11  
And maybe that comes a little bit easier for you than others because of you being a first generation college graduate. 


Christina Ortega  14:18  
Yeah, I definetly because I was in their shoes, right. I was lost and confused and didn't understand what a unit count is, when the withdrawal deadline was, or how to fill out a FAFSA and that I could get financial aid to help me pay for school. I share that often with my students, and I make myself real to them and share my own background. That, you know, my parents immigrated to the United States, they worked in the fields. And so when I tell them that they begin to open up and they're just like, “Oh, you're one of me, you understand what I'm going through”. Then they’re able to open up a little bit more and disclose what they're struggling with.


Interviewer  15:03  
Because the shame is not there anymore.


Christina Ortega  15:05  
Yeah, the shame or they're not embarrassed that they just got off the shift working in the berries kind of thing. I think when I share those things, they also get encouragement that they can do this too.


Interviewer  15:23  
And I can only imagine how proud your parents probably are. 


Christina Ortega  15:25
Yes, they are very proud. 


# TYPICAL DAY STRUCTURE
Interviewer  15:30  
Probably pretty motivating for you. Do you want to talk about what your typical maybe day or week looks like?


Christina Ortega  15:36  
As transfer coordinator, I'm in lots of meetings, coordinating meetings with transfer reps, meetings with students, and helping just kind of navigate the transfer process. Then the other part of the time I'm meeting one on one with students for our appointments, talking about their educational journey where they want to transfer or if they want to do one of our occupational programs at Cabrillo. So yeah, lots of talking all day.


Interviewer  16:06  
Yeah, that sounds pretty good, though, and such meaningful work too.


Christina Ortega  16:09  
it is definitely a very rewarding career.


# DIFFERNT ASPECTS OF THE JOB
Interviewer  16:13  
Do you want to talk about some of your more favorite parts of your job?


Christina Ortega  16:16  
It'd be meeting with students Yeah, being on the ground, meeting with students and helping them find their path; helping them find opportunities. Believing in them when they don't really believe in themselves, is the best part. My favorite day, and I think every counselor will speak to this as graduation. Or in the spring, when they're getting their acceptance letters, and they come running to you, or you get that email at 3am that they got accepted to Cal Poly is the best feeling in the world. 


Even though I'm so proud of them, they've done such amazing work, but part of me is like, I feel an accomplishment, you know. Like I help them navigate this path, and maybe believed in them when they didn't believe in themselves and encouraged them to apply to a school when they didn't think was attainable. And they did it. And that is the best part.


Interviewer  17:13  
Yeah. Because without that support the motivation might not have been there for people to continue, so it's a pretty big part, I think in someone's career journey. 


Christina Ortega  17:23  
Yeah, definitely. I agree. It's, it's a very, very rewarding career.


# SCHEDULE
Interviewer  17:27  
Do you want to talk about your typical hours that you might work in like a day or week?


Christina Ortega  17:33  
Yeah. So I'm very thankful to have a very flexible schedule. Where if I wanted to come at nine and stay till five, I could. So I do 31 contact hours a week and I'm an early riser. I like to go to work at eight, but I like to go to a gym class on Friday and start at 10 and you know, end at 1. So it is pretty flexible. There are evenings that we have to work, like when we have college and career night or when we have different workshops, especially in the fall. But mostly it is Monday through Friday, which is nice.


Interviewer  18:08  
Okay. But it's possible that like, maybe the emails backup, so you might find yourself or do you have good boundaries with that? Or is it hard? 


Christina Ortega  18:16  
Don't listen to me, but I have horrible boundaries. I’m often working some afternoons and weekends to catch up during our busy time. And that's just kind of part of the job. Because there are certain deadlines that students have to hit that I can't sleep on my email. I'm trying to get better at it, but that is also just my perfectionist mentality.


Interviewer  18:42  
When you were working for UCSC was it more hours or less hours because you have a lot more students? 


Christina Ortega  18:48  
At UCSC you're actually staff as an advisor, so you're working 40 hours a week. And then with having such a big caseload, I was working most afternoons, evenings and weekends; which I would say this opportunity at Cabrillo has a much better work life balance.


# MISCONCEPTIONS BEFORE THE JOB
Interviewer  19:08  
Yeah, that's nice. Thank you for sharing that. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the What to Be show on KSQD Santa Cruz 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart, and I'm speaking to Christina Ortega, who is an academic counselor at Cabrillo College. Christina, do you want to talk about maybe? Did you have any misconceptions about becoming a counselor before you started?


Christina Ortega  19:31  
I think before I started you read the catalog, you help students, you kind of forget about that, and you go on to the next one. But it's so much more than that. You really gain connections with the students, and check in on them and when they have a bad day or they're going through a really hard struggle. You take that home, and that's the part I didn't realize when I was in graduate school. 


I knew I didn't want to be a therapist because I knew I couldn't take all of that home, but I still get that in this role. When you have a student that is struggling with depression, anxiety, suicidal, or they have a really bad family home life that your heart just breaks for them. You want to take them home and help them out, but you can't and you can't fix it for them. I think that's the hardest part of my job. Probably the hardest days when I can't fix it, or I can't make it better. I can point them to the right resources, and get them the support they need, but I do have sleepless nights when I can't make it right.


Interviewer  20:42  
I mean, you just do the best you can, right? 


Christina Ortega  20:45  
Yeah. I'm working on that boundary, too. 


# MEMORABLE MOMENTS
Interviewer  20:48  
We all are they’re tough. What do you think has been the most memorable part of your career so far?


Christina Ortega  20:55  
The students. The students are amazing. I've had first generation students who started in our lowest math class, transfer to Cal Poly in computer engineering, have full rides, do an internship at Ambari, get picked up by Google, and now he's in the master's program. I call them my kids, but no, they're not my kids but my students. They just they make me so incredibly proud of the obstacles that they've overcome. The perseverance and the motivation that they have is the best part of my job to see that and to witness that and to be a part of their team and watch them transfer and watch them get that, you know, full time job at Apple or Google is the best feeling in the world.


Interviewer  21:49  
Yeah. I'm not surprised about that. And that's in the we're talking about kind of a misconception. I guess, before you start, you don't really maybe understand how great it's going to feel helping guide these people to successful futures. 


Christina Ortega  22:03  
Totally.When I had a larger caseload, it was it was sad that that students were just kind of like a number. Here, I know their story. I know how proud their parents are. I've met their parents at graduation, their parents have jumped on a zoom call and thanked me for everything that I've done, and that's what keeps me going. That's what you know, those long hard days are those, you know, 12 hour afternoons with endless emails. It's all worth for something when you think about those success stories. 


# FACULTY AT CABRILLO
Interviewer  22:37  
Yeah. I can just go on about just how amazing Cabrillo is and just how great the faculty is there. So it must be nice working with such great people, right?


Christina Ortega  22:46  
Yeah, I mean, I love Cabrillo, they all are truly there to support their students. They love their job, they love teaching, they love seeing students succeed, and iit really is a family. Like, I've never worked in a environment where we're truly friends we actually like each other.


Interviewer  23:14  
And even you know, Matt Wettstein came on the show, and he was really great. And hearing his story was so inspiring. I was a little bit intimidated. My principal, he's so cool.


Christina Ortega  23:24  
President Matt is is pretty awesome. We're really lucky to have him as a leader. 


Interviewer  23:28  
Yeah, that's what I thought; Cabrillo is very fortunate to have this person. 


Christina Ortega  23:31  
Yeah, he's very humble, he's great, he's a great leader. Even through these COVID times, he has done a great job, so we're very lucky.


# DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE JOB
Interviewer  23:42  
Was there anything surprising to you when you first started?


Christina Ortega  23:47  
Probably the hours. I was shocked that I could only have to work 10 months a year. But I didn't think I was going to love my job as much as I actually do. I'm with the transfer staff, I'm doing more of the coordination and helping students not just individually but on a bigger level. I'm really enjoying that to make system changes at Cabrillo to make the transfer experience smoother for them. I'm really enjoying that part of it. I didn't think I'd be so connected with my students, but I'm very lucky.


Interviewer  24:25  
That's awesome. And what do you think is has been the least favorite part of your job or more, most stressful?


Christina Ortega  24:41  
I think sometimes in order to get things done, something that can be a little difficult in higher education, is to move things along. Even though I love the transfer coordination part, sometimes there's bureaucracies that you have, and hoops you have to jump through; that can be kind of frustrating. When they make a change, say to the portal or something and they don't tell counselors, but they don't realize the trickle down effect and how it's going to affect students. That's really frustrating. 


I'm very lucky that as a counselor I am in different meetings, and have made such great connections at Cabrillo that people really respect counselors' opinions. We can voice our opinion and explain why that doesn't work for the student, and it's taken well. So that's really nice. It's a much smaller community than working at the university and I really enjoy that. So even though every job has its downfalls, and we're able to get through it.


Interviewer  25:51  
Well, I think Cabrillo is very fortunate to have you there. 


Christina Ortega  25:54
Thanks.


# MENTORSHIP
Interviewer  25:55
Did you have a mentor going through school, someone you could look up to and bounce stuff off? Maybe it was a counselor, maybe someone in life?


Christina Ortega  26:04  
One of my best mentors that I've ever had is another Cabrillo counselor. His name's Jay Jackson; he actually just retired. He's been at Cabrillo since the late 90s. As soon as I came to Cabrillo as an evaluator, he really took me underneath his wing. He, I think, saw potential in me. He really guided me and had so much patience with me teaching me how to evaluate transcripts, and also encouraged me to apply for full time roles; where I don't know if I would have without his encouragement. And even once I was hired at Cabrillo, he just showed me how to be the best counselor possible. I really attribute a lot of my success and a lot of my attributes to him. He's just an amazing person. And I'm going to miss him. I'm lucky enough to still be friends with him after he retires, but it's going to be weird walking in on the first day of school and not be there.


Interviewer  27:09  
I wouldn't be surprised that maybe you're a mentor for other people too.


Christina Ortega  27:14  
I hope so.


Interviewer  27:16  
Kind of goes with your job a little bit.


Christina Ortega  27:18  
Yeah, I have students reaching out to me on LinkedIn, or when I see them out and about in the county, they're just like, you changed my life, thank you for that, and I'm so grateful for you. So I would hope so I hope I'm doing my due diligence. 


Interviewer  27:33  
Sure sounds like it. Christina, what advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career in becoming an academic counselor?


Christina Ortega  27:41  
I think start even when you're in grad school, and this is one of my big regrets. When you were an undergrad and grad school, start seeking out opportunities in student services or in education, even if you're a receptionist, or the front desk at an office, and just start seeing what type of populations you want to work with. 


All of that will help your resume down the road, but also will help you decide what student population you want to work with. And where your heart really lies. Is it outreach? Is it retention? Is it counseling, or maybe it's just teaching. Like I never thought I would teach, and I that's one part of my job that I love. So, you know, just kind of get your foot in the door, and also kind of sample different types of opportunities and student services. Don't just go through grad school without an internship or a part time job and graduate because it's gonna be really hard to get a job.


Interviewer  28:38  
that's great advice. Thanks for sharing that.


Christina Ortega  28:39  
Yeah, I think that goes for every job actually, not just counseling.


# CAREER PATH ADVICE
Interviewer  28:42  
What about advice for someone who is unsure about their career path?


Christina Ortega  28:47  
Do your research. I don't want to do another plug about Cabrillo, this is about me and not Cabrillo, but we have amazing career resources. Start doing your research, do informational interviews, go and talk to you know, if it's, you want to be a nurse or a doctor or an accountant or a recruiter. Find someone reach out to them on LinkedIn, ask them for a coffee date, or a 10 minute phone call and just pick their brain. What are the good parts of the job? What are the bad parts of the job? What was your own educational path, because major doesn't always equal career. And so just do your research. No one can tell you what you should be because you're gonna be very unhappy if that if that's what you're expecting. You need to find it yourself. Just do your research and try things; trial and error. That's the only way you're gonna figure it out.
