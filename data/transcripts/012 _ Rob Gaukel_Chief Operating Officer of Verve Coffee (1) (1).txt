#ABOUT VERVE
Rob  0:57  
Yeah, I'm the Chief Operating Officer for coffee roasters


Interviewer  1:00  
in Santa Cruz?


Rob  1:01  
Yep, yeah, we're our corporate offices, right at our roastery in Seabright., right, so right next to the climbing gym and Pacific edge.


Interviewer  1:10  
So how many locations are there in Santa Cruz? There's the one at Pacific. 


Rob  1:13  
Yeah, we have four locations in Santa Cruz. We have three in LA, we have one in San Francisco, and three in Japan. And we'll be opening up a new roastery in LA here shortly and a new cafe in Palo Alto. And I forgot we have one on the Facebook campus as well. So yeah, it's relatively new. It's just just for Facebook employees, but it's our cafe that we run for them. So yep.


Interviewer  1:40  
So how did this all start? I mean, you can just say, yeah.


Rob  1:45  
So I joined Verve a little over three years ago now. And I joined as the what was my initial title? I was in finance and accounting. And so my background is kind of in finance, accounting and operations. How did it all start, I was looking for a job because I had sold a couple of businesses of my own. And I had just wrapped up the sale of my father's business, and was basically looking for a job.


Interviewer  2:21  
And at that time, was Verve, like so much smaller?


Rob  2:24  
Yeah, it was it had, I think we were had six cafes at that time. So we've kind of doubled in size since I've been there. And you know, the position initially was just kind of finance and accounting, and I kind of gravitated towards more of a operational role. And hence now being the Chief Operating Officer.


#COO RESPONSIBILITIES
Interviewer  2:46  
So I'm like a day to day, what are some of the things you do?


Rob  2:50  
Yeah, day to day. I mean, I'm I ultimately am responsible for kind of all facets of operation. And so at verve, we have our retail, our cafes that many people are familiar with. And so I have a retail team that rolls up to me. I'm in charge of accounting and finance. Also, our wholesale team rolls up to me. So we do a lot of sales to wholesale accounts, we sell into a lot of tech campuses, in the Bay Area. Right here close to us. Plantronics is a customer, for example, visor, coffee. So there's our wholesale side of the business that I support. And day to day, I mean, there's a lot of projects that I'm also involved with all the build outs. So I have a store development team that works on building out our cafes that I that I support. So there's a lot of project management is the day to day, a lot of emails to be answered, a lot of spreadsheet work. And a lot of just kind of coordination of people internally and externally to support the various projects and initiatives that we're working on. So you're


Interviewer  4:05  
in charge of basically all the all the branches.


Rob  4:09  
Yes, I like to say that I try to keep I try to keep the lights on everything moving forward. Everything, everything going. So I'm also a CPA, so, you know, I have a background in accounting. And so I joke that I'm literally a bean counter counting beans. But yeah, I mean, I you know it I think this role is Chief Operating Officer. I mean, ultimately, you know, I, I make sure that things keep moving forward and the direction that you know, is set out by myself and the rest of our executive team. So


Interviewer  4:50  
And is the position what you thought it would be?


Rob  4:56  
Yeah, I mean, I think that, there's always a lot to learn. And I think that in a position like, operations, or accounting and finance, or any position for that matter, I mean, if you are willing to kind of raise your hand and take on new projects, or new challenges that you learn a lot, so I didn't expect to know, learn so much, or need to learn so much about building out cafes, or building out a roastery, or developing new products. You know, we just launched a product in a can I didn't know anything about putting coffee into a can. So yeah, those are all things that I had no idea that I would have to be responsible for figure out and going into it. Yeah, I mean, it, um, I have never had as big of a team. And so I've never had as many direct reports, as I as I have now. So, you know, kind of being an effective leader. You know, I had to figure out and so there's, there's challenges around communication. I've never had to manage a team that wasn't kind of in a central office. I mean, since we have cafes in LA, and the Bay Area and San Francisco and Japan, there's there's just a lot to, you know, figure out that communication, you know, so it's been, you know, it's been a chat, not not a challenge in a negative way. But it's been a challenge to and continues to be to try to figure out, you know, effective ways to communicate across regions, time zones, you know, cultures, so.


Interviewer  6:49  
Yeah, because it must be it must operate differently in Japan.


Rob  6:52  
Yeah, yeah. No, it does, Exactly, yeah. Now, there's a lot of differences. And, you know, we actually learn a lot from each other, on how we're delivering the brand and products. So, yeah.


#EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE
Interviewer  7:06  
So could you walk us, I guess, through your education? Sure. Your journey towards the Chief Operating Officer?


Rob  7:11  
Yeah, I mean, Journey is the correct way to describe it. So yeah, I went to Aptos high. And afterwards, attended Santa Clara University, I thought that I wanted to be a doctor, started as a chemistry major. Got a C in organic chemistry and was devastated. Thought I could never become a doctor and dropped all my science classes and took a random set of classes, and one of them being economics, and I enjoyed it. So I continued on studying economics. The interesting part was for me, I was already in the School of Arts and Sciences. So I didn't take any business. That economics was either in the business school or arts and sciences, so I didn't have any business classes. And afterwards, I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do. So I took a job as a financial analyst at a semiconductor company. And the unique situation there was it was a rotational program. So I was able to rotate through a bunch of departments within the company. And so I got a great, great exposure to all kinds of different accounting and finance type positions in the semiconductor company. From there, I decided to move back to Santa Cruz because I missed despite not being that far away, I just miss living on this side of the hill. And I started working for my dad's company that always kind of worked at. That was kind of my summer job. He has a whole he had a wholesale meat distributorship. So I, you know, I continue to work with him because ultimately, the person that he was kind of his main person ended up leaving for various reasons, and I kind of filled that position. And from there, you did a lot of all kinds of things at the company from our accounting or finance or sales, purchasing, just kind of general operations. And it's, I don't know if either of you have ever worked with family, it can be difficult. So I worked there for almost eight years and decided that I needed to change. And I went back to Santa Clara and got a Certificate of Advanced Accounting proficiency, which allowed me to take the CPA and get my CPA certificate or license. And from there I worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is a large, global accounting firm and really thought that I was going to pursue a career as a CPA, but after a year decided that I wanted to be more on in India Isn't it's rather than just a consultant and rather than just someone that was presumptive providing a service. So as I said, it was a journey. So I bought a few businesses after that. Went back working for my dad, and then ended up at Verve after I sold those businesses.


Interviewer  7:15  
CPA is certified public accountant? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And so what was your first job? 


Rob  8:03  
After college, or before college? my very first job was in the family.


Interviewer  10:36  
What job during college, or before, I think, before you graduated, had the most impact. 


Rob  10:45  
Now that I'm at verve, my time spent at Starbucks. But no, I had I had an internship that actually, it was impactful because I was thinking about doing kind of public policy in economics and kind of working with public policy issues. So I worked in on it was a nonprofit that was it was called joint ventures, Silicon Valley. And it was there to try to help not promote, but but look at what was working and not working for companies in Silicon Valley and try to help companies and, and municipalities and even education, to make sure that the best of the best aspects of the Silicon Valley were promoted, and that some of the problems are also being addressed. So we did things like everything from how do you solve the traffic that the Silicon Valley has, you know, to? How do we keep attracting, you know, talent into tech companies. But in working there, I decided that I didn't want to pursue public policy. So that was very impactful.


#PERSONAL JOURNEY
Interviewer  12:00  
It's like those positions or those, those experiences about like, push you towards a different direction.


Rob  12:07  
Exactly I think you always learn from them. Right. And I think that that's, you know, it's, I didn't clearly know what I wanted to do. I always wanted to be many things, and I've pursued many things. And each time I pursued something new, I learned something that I was able to apply to my next position. So


Interviewer  12:33  
Would you say that you're still on the journey right now?I mean, are you still trying? 


Rob  12:38  
Oh, for sure. Yeah. I mean, it. I think that no matter what you do, I think that you're going to be more successful if you take that type of mindset into your position that you have to always grow and learn, no matter what you're doing. And you have to continue to be flexible and open minded and trying to improve not only yourself, but whatever you're doing for that position. So yeah, I'm completely still on on a journey. And so


Interviewer  13:12  
Is there something that keeps motivating you to keep growing and keep expanding?


Rob  13:18  
Yeah, I think that I've always naturally kind of had that drive, I guess. You know, for example, you know, I always, I always wanted to be a pilot. And so I got my pilot's license, you know, when I was 17, but then decided that I didn't want to be a pilot as a career, but through that, like that kind of just hunger for something new, you know, I learned to that I can take something somewhat complex and figure it out and be successful at it. So yeah, it honestly forgot your original question. So


Interviewer  14:10  
If you can go back and do anything differently? I guess, academically, professionally, personally, what would it be?


Speaker 1  14:19  
It's very good question. I wouldn't worry as much about not knowing. So, you know, like I like I was saying before, like, I there was a lot of things that I thought I wanted to be and you know, they can cause it can cause a lot of it can be stressful, not necessarily knowing or pursuing one thing and then finding out that no, that's not what you thought it was, and therefore you're not going to take that direction. And so I think that if I could go back, I would, you know, embrace not knowing and continue to be Be curious without the stress of oh, I need to know. Or, you know, I need to find that job or I need to, you know, quote unquote figure it out. So I think the decisions I made, I learned a lot along the way, there it just, you know, I wish I wouldn't I wish I wasn't so stressed about them.


Interviewer  15:25  
I mean, that YFIOB we work with high school students. So I guess my question would be, what is a piece of advice that you have for a student who feels lost?


Rob  15:35  
Lost? Yeah, I would say that, it's that that's an opportunity to while you know, and acknowledge that it is stressful feeling that way. But it's an opportunity to continue to explore. And, you know, I wouldn't, at such a young age as a high schooler, like, I wouldn't worry about feeling lost. And then I would take many different directions, because that's what you, that's what's going to help you ultimately to find what you, you know, gravitate towards. But it's embracing that and being okay with it. And taking that as an opportunity to explore. 


Interviewer  16:24  
I think we all go through that. I mean, when I was in high school, I wanted to be a nurse. Like, I'm not interested in anything medical now. Yeah. So. So yeah, that's definitely something. 


Speaker 1  16:35  
And then you can that at such at any age, I mean, I might, when I went, when I changed kind of directions, I was in my mid 30s. And then I went to work at this big, you know, accounting firm, where, you know, my, you know, my peers, those that were first year, you know, CPAs, were straight out of college, you know, and it doesn't, you know, you can change course, and it's okay. And, and, you know, ultimately, I think those kinds of changes just help kind of fill your, your sort of personal and professional toolkit.


Interviewer  17:13  
was there someone instrumental to your success?


Rob  17:18  
Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, working with my dad certainly was a very powerful experience. And, you know, my, both my parents, my mom as well, for a time there, I was thinking about education. And so, you know, her being an educator. So and then along the way, I mean, I had a lot of managers that my first job I had, I had a manager that that I was warned was a very difficult manager to work for, but he ended up teaching me a ton, you know, and I'm like, this was right out of college as a financial analyst. And, you know, I think that he instilled you know, a strong work ethic, he worked hard, and I wanted to make sure to, you know, live up to his expectations. And he taught me a lot, you know, I knew nothing about Excel and spreadsheets, and after working with him, you know, I would I don't want to say I was a wizard, but I came away with knowing far more than nothing.


Interviewer  18:34  
So how much about coffee, do you have to know, in your job?


Speaker 1  18:39  
No, I mean, that's, it's that's all part of the learning process. You know, I kind of joked earlier that that job in college was my time at Starbucks, but it's, you know, it, I didn't think that I, I've always kind of been in the food industry. You know, the family business was a wholesale meat industry at a few small food companies on my own. So I kind of understand the food industry at large, but didn't have any specific coffee knowledge other than my time in Starbucks. So it's all been I've picked it up along the way, you know, and that, you know, I think that's another kind of good lesson to point out is that you don't necessarily need to know the specifics, right. But if you have this general kind of experience, you know, you could step into, you know, a company that's in the food industry, maybe I don't know much about coffee, but I know quite a bit about the food industry, and I know quite a bit about accounting that allows you to like, step into something that is different in its in its product or delivery or specifics, but you know, enough in general to, you know, be successful. 


#OPPURTUNITIES AT VERVE
Interviewer  19:48  
And how many careers would you say, career pathways? Would you say there is at Verve?


Speaker 1  19:55  
I mean, that's a good question. I mean, we're, I think there's more than usual because we have Have these kinds of different channels of business, you know, so we have a retail side. So there's career paths in retail. We develop even even within retail, we kind of develop other pathways. So if you don't want to go into management in retail, there's educational opportunities, you know, because we have to train all of our staff. So we have trainers, there's sales opportunities, because we have a wholesale department. There, we have a lot of internal marketing, a lot of internal web design, and there's purchasing, whether it be the green coffee or just for our, you know, supplies and whatnot that go into our cafes. So, it you know, it being a medium sized business, there's, you know, every every part of business is, you know, we there's a pathway adverb basically.


Interviewer  21:00  
And that's an important point is, I think, when you're in high school, the only options you see is like, doctor and firefighter, the most cliche careers, but I think interviewing guests, like previous guests, they just have so within the organization, they have so many different kinds of like, different fields and subfields. 


Rob  21:21  
No, and it's something that I didn't know, as a high schooler, I wanted to be a doctor. Right. And, you know, I, you know, I know that. So. It it's a really good point. I mean, there are in most companies, you know, it's more than just what they actually do, right? I mean, there's a lot of support in companies than just the product or service that they offer, they can be a career pathway. So


Interviewer  21:53  
and you said, even yourself, like a verb, you kind of had a role, but then you expand it to like, what it needed to be right. You wanted it to be right.


Rob  22:02  
Yeah. And I think that that, you know, um, I think that a lot of that was just back to my kind of curious nature. And, and, you know, I think that, as someone in operations, whether it's the Chief Operating Officer, or an operations manager, or supervisor or coordinator, or project manager, those are all kind of, you know, the sort of job titles that you may feed into a chief operating officer someday, I think that you need to be curious, flexible, and basically just have this drive to get stuff done, because that's ultimately what you're charged to do. So, yeah, it's operations is a very interesting career path, if you just like to have a wide scope of business, and like to, in general, kind of drive things forward. And then accounting. You know, if you're interested in business, I didn't, I didn't get into accounting until after I was part of my family's business for eight years, I honestly dropped my only accounting class in undergrad. Because I thought this is I don't need this. But ultimately went back and got my CPA and if you're interested in business, and you're interested in like, growing as a leader within business, I mean, understanding accounting and being able to follow the money, I mean, that that's how you really get a grasp of business. Right? Because that, you know, you're you're able to see so much of a business when you are accounting for it. 


Interviewer  23:45  
Have you traveled a lot with Verve?


Rob  23:48  
I get to go to LA a lot. No, I there are opportunities. I'm supposed to go to Honduras in May, but I may instead be opening up our roastery in LA. So there we do send our cafe managers and we send our wholesale team and we have a program where we send baristas to Japan. So, we do kind of have like, different travel opportunities for people.


Interviewer  24:15  
So these baristas are recruited from the States or?


Rob  24:18  
no, we on the baristas in Japan are all from from Japan. But we do kind of we've had had kind of like an exchange program in the past where we'll send some of our baristas there, and they'll have some baristas here in Santa Cruz. 


Interviewer  24:31  
That's really cool because I think that opens perspectives up for Americans and for both Japanese


Rob  24:35  
Yeah, for sure. Yeah no, it's a cool opportunity. And just the coffee industry in general is a very global, you know, industry with a lot of the coffee being grown and, you know, South America and Africa. So it you know, in general, I think that the coffee industry is quite global and has global opportunity to be to travel and to be kind of have a more global perspective.


#WHAT MAKES A GOOD LEADER
Interviewer  24:35  
In your opinion, what's what are some good qualities of a of a good leader?


Rob  25:06  
That's a very good question. I think that you have to be, you definitely have to be a good listener, you definitely have to be, but at the same time be confident without being a micromanager or overbearing. As I'm thinking about your answer, these are all things that I'm continuing to work on. So, yeah, yeah. And I think I strive to be a good leader by leading by example. And there's nothing that I would ask anyone that I lead that I wouldn't do myself. And so I think to sum up the answer that that it's a good leader leads by example. 


Interviewer  25:59  
Its short and sweet. 


Rob  26:01  
I have no fear of cleaning bathrooms, and I have cleaned bathrooms, that verb and I have no fear of even, you know, I'll jump on behind the register. I'll do dishes, I'll do anything and everything. Anyone that works for me does and, and I think that that's what, yeah, is a good leader.


Interviewer  26:22  
and what are some of your favorite parts about your job? Or favorite memory? 


Rob  26:25  
Yeah no, I think the all the learning. Yeah, I mean, I think the ability I'm not, I think the perspective it gives me for the company overall, and all the learning that I've had to do. So I it's a challenge, and it keeps me growing, and it keeps me interested.


Interviewer  26:44  
I think I asked this, but when you when you first started out for how many locations were there?


Rob  26:49  
We had six


Interviewer  26:51  
and now there's?


Rob  26:51  
12 Yeah, 


Interviewer  26:53  
so it's double? 


Rob  26:55  
Yeah. And well, you know, we continue to grow.


Interviewer  27:02  
So was there anything else you want to achieve? Whether it be a Verve or just in your life right now that you're still like striving for?


Rob  27:10  
Yeah, um, I think back to the leadership question, I mean, I, I want to continue to, well, I think leading by example is important. There's many other aspects of being a good leader. And I want to continue to, you know, work on those those aspects of being a good leader. You know, at Verve on, you know, there there are, you're continuing to grow and learn and continue to help the company grow and be successful. So, and in learn whatever tools or whatever new projects or tasks that I'm set to do, you know, to keep striving and moving forward.


Interviewer  27:57  
So the last question we have for you is, what is one thought or piece of advice you would like to leave our listeners with?


Rob  28:04  
Yeah, I think I would go back to your question about feeling lost, and I don't, and, that being okay, and not not trying to overcome the stress that that may, that you may feel about being lost and trying to turn that around into curiosity. And knowing that, you know, there are, you know, there's a lot of time in your life, and not necessarily knowing what you want to do as a young person is okay. But continuing and discovering and making it a journey is what it's about. And I know it's stressful, but but just trying to to turn that stress or that feeling of loss into curiosity


Interviewer  28:59  
that they can take you along a long way. Yeah. Well, thank you so much for being here with us today and telling us a part of your story.
