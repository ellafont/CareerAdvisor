Susan O'Connor Fraser  1:00  
Thank you, Patrick, for having me.

# EARLY CAREER AND INDUSTRY BASICS

Interviewer  1:02  
And Susan is the creative director and executive producer of Tam Communications. Susan, would you please explain your career journey with us?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  1:09  
I was actually a computer programmer back in the 70s. And I was pretty good at it, but didn't really enjoy the culture and technology. And so I was searching for something else. And my husband grew up in Hollywood. And he actually had a dream one night where he was in a helicopter and John Wayne was on the ground as the helicopter landed and reached out his hand and shook his hand and said, "Welcome to the business." And yeah, it was the inspiration. And so Tam and I formed this company in 1979. It's been an incredible experience and life journey. And we still work together and love each other and like each other here/ 41 years later.

Interviewer  2:03  
That's really cool. I love that story too, about the dream. How awesome. What do you what are your main duties and responsibilities?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  2:11  
Well as executive producer. First, I manage all of the various projects we have in house. That could be television commercials, it could be radio commercials, and a lot of corporate videos, social media channels that we manage for some of our clients, where we're doing postings or uploading videos we've created for them. And so we have sometimes as many as 40, to 50 projects in house at any one time. So that's my job as executive producer. As creative director, I'm coming up with concepts of how to help one of our clients, all of our clients, create and deliver their message, whether it's to new employees, or existing employees, or customers or prospective customers. And then I also write almost all of the scripts that come through the house. So that could be again, television, radio copy, or video copy.

Interviewer  3:08  
Has that changed during right now with COVID?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  3:11  
Well, our business definitely has been impacted. One of our largest clients is the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. So they of course, are not doing as much projects. Good Guys, a hot rod and custom show, is also another client of ours and they cut back severely this year. We have done a lot of COVID messaging for clients, because our largest client is Satellite Health Care, and they're a dialysis company. So helping the those health care workers understand, keeping them motivated, keeping them trained on how to keep themselves safe, how to educate their patients on how to stay safe. Our work overall, the amount of work actually hasn't changed because we've replaced what paid business that we've lost with a lot of pro bono work with nonprofits and small businesses here, especially in Scotts Valley.

Interviewer  4:07  
Susan, would you please tell us about your education background?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  4:10  
So I have a degree in liberal arts from DeAnza College, and then I started at San Jose State and then dropped out because as a lot of people do or change majors, but I dropped out and because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life at that time. I always love to write and so in order to get the job as a computer programmer, I needed to get an AA degree and so I did that, or an associate's degree of some kind. I did that and then Locky trained me as a computer programmer. And during that time, I took a lot of courses in business, which I then went to an extension program with the University of Redlands and continued in the business area learning more about business management and accounting and all the things that go into running a successful business. And I am actually three units away from my Bachelors of Science degree in Business. After we started our business, I did not really have the motivation to go back and get those that that extra three credits and who knows how much how many it would be right now. So I have no training really in film or video production. But I've been a writer since I was a child, and knew that was something that I was good at. And then also had the business acumen to help support Tam, my husband and partner, in this adventure of ours.

Interviewer  5:44  
Yeah and it sounds like you've written reading about some of your bio, some of the stuff you've done, you know, helping co-develop and you're the executive producer of an internationally syndicated television series called Coast Guard. That must have been a really fun project for you, I would imagine.

Susan O'Connor Fraser  6:00  
It was. It was super fun. Tam had joined the Coast Guard right before we got married and then ended up... He had a back injury from playing sports in high school and so had to drop out of the Coast Guard after just 27 days at training camp. But we originally pitched to the Coast Guard motion picture office and idea to do a feature film or television series, a fictional series. And we just couldn't get that off the ground. And then in the early 90s, mid 90s, we came when reality television was just coming out, we pitched this idea of a Coast Guard reality show. And through that we've shot all across the country we've been on scene for drug busts, and migrant interdictions where people are trying to enter the country illegally. We actually went up to Alameda and watched and captured Michelle Obama christening a national security cutter up there. I flew in a helicopter around the eye of the Big Island as we shot a feature on Coast Guard, Air Station, barber outside of Honolulu. And we've done features that took us even to Japan, where they were doing exercises with the Japanese Coast Guard. So taken us all over the country in the world. And Tam actually, during the course of one of the discovery documentaries that we created was on a navy frigate with a Coast Guard, law enforcement detachment team, where they were chasing drug runners between Colombia and Panama. So that was one of his adventures that I was a part of.

Interviewer  7:52  
Wow, it sounds like quite an experience.

Susan O'Connor Fraser  7:55  
It is, I mean, I still to this day, have so much respect and for members of the Coast Guard and the service they provide to our country. And in fact, about 2005, we pitched an idea to the military channel to cover the Coast Guard in Vietnam, before the Vietnam War, or during the Vietnam War. And most people didn't know that our Coast Guard was the first naval units over there in Vietnam. And then they did so many other things there to help support the US efforts in that war. And but when they came back, because it was such an unpopular war, which is understandable, they were almost like, disowned by the coast guard themselves. The Coast Guard didn't want to admit that they had any role in that and because it would tarnish their image. So telling, their story had never been told before. So I had this immense pressure to deliver something that was a story that had never been told by these amazing human beings. When we finished and we sent copies to the different people we had interviewed, the recognition and appreciation that came back from that was one of the I say, most satisfying experiences of my life.

# CAREER REQUIREMENTS AND SKILLS

Interviewer  9:17  
Wow, that's awesome. And going back to your work, could you tell us briefly like what a day or work week looks like for you?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  9:26  
There's no typical day and a work week can be seven days long, because we own our own company. Now if you're in the video business working for another company, you may not work those kinds of hours. But since we're this is our own company, we kind of call the shots of when we get started. And when we end our day, and all the moving from one project to the next through the course of the day, unless I'm scripting in which case I tried to get myself into a space where I can shut out the world and really go deep into my imagination, we do that a lot, where our daughter is a producer for our company. And she's also an amazing talented director. She's also the last set of eyes that sees anything before we share it because we call her Eagle Eye Ayman, because she's so intent on the details, and will see things that I don't see. So it's every day is different. And I love that about the job. Every day is different. I'm learning something new every day, because we have such a wide variety of clients. It just keeps life interesting.

Interviewer  10:34  
And that's really cool. Especially to be working so close with your family, too. I think that's awesome. What kind of skills do you use in your career? And did you acquire these skills just through working the job?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  10:46  
Yeah, I think you know, the business is definitely gets put to use. We have a bookkeeper, an operations manager that does most of that. But I put sales skills to get new business together, I'm using my using marketing skills I learned in college to spread the word of our company to new potential clients. I'm obviously writing, which I didn't take in school other than the required, you know, English that you had to take. That is something that's been more of a passion. As I said, since I was a child. I, as a producer, project manager, that's something I think that you either have that capability or you don't. To be able to manage and shuffle many things. And I use customer service skills because I you know, we're serving multiple clients, both Regan and I, in keep making sure they're beyond happy with what we do. I also use different tools of the Adobe Creative Suite, specifically Photoshop and Illustrator to prep graphics for Tam or photos for Tam to use in editing. Looking at all the things on my toolbar here. I think that's about it. Yeah. I mean, it's a lot of things that people that if you're any of your listeners go into this business, they can be more in a specific area where, for example, our 2D artist, he uses After Effects and Photoshop and Illustrator and probably other parts of the Creative Suite. Our 3D artist. That's all he does, is 3D art and animation. I'm what they call a hyphenate. I wear so many hats. I would prefer that from just being a writer or just being a producer. To be able to do all those things and bring more value to what we deliver for our customers.

# CAREER IMPACTS AND PROJECTS

Interviewer  11:22  
I know you talked about being the executive producer for the show, Coast Guard. But what are some of your other favorite projects you've worked on and or currently working on?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  12:53  
Other favorite projects? Wow. It's such a variety. I mean, we I we did a take on the great Game of Thrones opening title sequence a couple of years ago for the Boardwalk. And instead of "Winter is Coming", which was a saying in that movie, it was "Summer is Coming". Yeah, where the boardwalk comes out of the sand and you see the dipper being raised out of the sand and then we fly through the park. And that was I think, a really rewarding thing. In addition to the 12 or so discovery documentaries we've done, Premies was one that we shot at Stanford at the neonatal intensive care unit. And that was a project that I wrote for just and just air on Discovery Channel. You know, we've done work for nonprofits recently, we completed a series of videos for the Community Foundation to help them raise money for the fire fund for fire victims. That was very rewarding. And I know that they're doing very well with those. 

Currently, we're actually working on a video for the documentary about the Boardwalk and the impact of the closure has on the community. Because it's so much more than just the place we go to have fun, you know. It's a place they're... You know, all the people that work there have been impacted by the closure. All the kids that look forward to their first job, you know, for a summer job there have been impacted by the closure. And then of course, the whole Santa Cruz economy is impacted by them being closed and, you know, so that's a project I'm really passionate about right now is to take that project and you know, hopefully be able to see it aired somewhere, you know, maybe on something like Netflix or Amazon Prime or if not there, then we'll find another way to get it out. So that the people of Santa Cruz and beyond can learn about this special place that we have here in Santa Cruz that's is so much a cog in the wheel that moves, you know, our economy.

Interviewer  15:12  
Well, that definitely sounds like a meaningful project. And I think a lot of us in the community, our heart goes out to the boardwalk and to all the communities that are being affected by what's going on right now. And is there any way that people can still support the boardwalk that you know of?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  15:28  
Currently, the only thing that they have open are some shops, food, so you could go down there and you know, take a walk on the walk and buy some food. They do have the drive in movies, right now. We're gonna go see Big tomorrow night. They're gonna do a nine o'clock. They're gonna celebrate the New Year with New York and do a live drop of the ball in Times Square on the stage, on the screen. And they're offering some really yummy food. The chef... not just the "good, bad for you" food. The chef for the last three months, I think, they've had this happy hours where the chef has paired beer with you know, some really good food. And not that they're... I don't know that they're having beer, but they're definitely cooking up some good eats for tomorrow night. So we're supporting them that way. Yeah. And then hopefully, they'll be open in some capacity beyond just the food and shopping. That they'll be able to, you know, have their games again outside by February, maybe, and the hopefully by spring, they'll have the bowling alley and maybe the arcades open again. And then hopefully ride by summer, if not earlier.

Interviewer  16:50  
Yeah, that sure would be nice. And for those just tuning in, you're listening to the what to be show on KSQD, Santa Cruz, 90.7 FM. And I'm Patrick Hart. And I'm speaking with Susan O'Connor Fraser, and learning more about Tam Communications. Susan, why is your job important to our society?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  17:09  
Well, I think having a thriving economy is important to our society. And so, all the stuff that we do for business communication, helping people, especially within the Bay Area, sell their products or keep their employees motivated, or train them to be better at their job. All of that is good for that reason. And as far as the business world goes, the stuff that we do with nonprofits, helps our community whether it's for the Community Foundation, we're also working right now with Second Harvest Food Bank to help get to help them with get the word out of the stuff they're doing. And we've worked with, we finished up some videos for the San Benito County Food Bank, and did some PSAs for all three, TriCounty Food Banks. So that's all good. And we've had nonprofit work that's been good part of our portfolio. Not always pro bono, but all of that stuff helps our community. And I think finally, the stuff that we do in more of the entertainment area or documentary is helping to have a more well informed community by informing viewers about different things or making them laugh. I mean, last year, or no it wasn't last year, it was maybe seven years ago now. We produced a two episode pilot, that was a reality show about life on the farm. And it aired on National Geographic television. 

And, you know, anything that we do in the area of humor is making people laugh. I mean, we need that more than anything right now. Some of the other stuff that we've done over the years just has... I mean, we use humor a lot, whenever we can, and then more recently, we've been doing stuff that's COVID related. Even before COVID, we did a music video called "Hands Clean" and based on the song "Hand Clap", "we can make your hand clap" and we changed the lyrics to be "you can wash your hands clean." This year we did another music video for the same client, Satellite Healthcare, on mask wearing and instead of "Raise your Glass" by P!nk it was wear your mask. And so those are really fun and I think all those safety messages are important. We worked with the Santa Cruz County Economic Recovery Council on two different videos. One that just got released last week, which is an animated piece on employee safety for workers throughout the county. You know, and especially those that are working in restaurants and stores and how to keep safe and how to keep our community healthy, safe, and open, which hopefully we will be open again you know in the coming month or two.

# ADVICE

Interviewer  19:38  
What advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing this career?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  20:08  
I would say that to, you know, invest their time in learning and practicing the part of the craft that they are passionate about. Make sure that they are passionate about it, because that does require passion. The tools are so inexpensive these days that you can, our first edit suite was three quarters of a million dollars. And now you can edit on your iPhone, actually, or on a small laptop. But to practice and find where where you want to land, if you're going to go and try to start your own business, is to focus your education on business type courses, you can learn some of these tools in online tutorials. You don't necessarily have to take an After Effects class, not saying college isn't important, but it's focusing your attention in college on things that will help you in life and help you in your business. Or if you're going to go to work for someone else help you understand the ways that what you do can help your employer--going to get communications classes, for example, or marketing classes, I think are all you know, great options. 

Our son wanted to go into our business and we said, "Well, that's fine, but you're gonna go to college, and we're going to pay for it and you're going to learn something else. So what is that going to be." He went into Decision Information Sciences, which is the marriage of technology and marketing. And now he's a web developer making a lot of money living in Ohio and Ohio cost of living and making Silicon Valley salaries from his business that he owns. So I think he's glad that our advice was to not go to film school because he could, he could learn that in the family business. And he did. The Dalai Lama came into town into Santa Clara University, which is where my son went to school, and Tam and I were going to be up in Vancouver for another client and Santa Clara University wanted us to capture the event and to then edit some videos for them. So Tim, our son, headed one crew and Reagan, our daughter headed the other and they captured that event. They were both the field producers of those two teams. That's another very rewarding project in mind even though I was not on set or on production for that creating the videos from the interviews that we that they captured and putting it together and reading the transcripts from all the different speakers that talked about compassion in Silicon Valley was just kind of was a turning point for me and my life as well.

Interviewer  23:00  
That sounds like it was a really beautiful time. I wish I would have gone. I remember hearing about that. Was that... that was a couple of years ago, I think?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  23:07  
Yeah, it might have been as many as six years ago. The years blur when you get a little older. It was, I think, might have been 2014. But it was, yeah, it was just a really beautiful event. And the interesting thing is that the reason it was at Santa Clara instead of Stanford, which was actually sponsoring the visit was because Stanford had an NCAA basketball game that day. So there were they didn't really have a place on campus to host it. So Santa Clara got the benefit of the fact that they didn't have an event going on at that time.

Interviewer  23:48  
That worked out for them pretty well. Right?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  23:50  
Right, yeah. And it was interesting too, and like my daughter and son got the experience that we had when we captured Michelle Obama christening the Coast Guard Cutter in what it's like to work with the Secret Service and the State Department and in her in the case of the Dalai Lama, it was more I may have been mostly the State Department and Homeland Security were with us at the Coast Guard out at Alameda. It was the Secret Service and Homeland Security.

Interviewer  24:22  
Susan, for your final question, are there any last things you'd like to share about your career or advice you'd like to leave our listeners with?

Susan O'Connor Fraser  24:31  
I think that, like I said before, I think passion is important that you need to love this, because it'll show up in your work. It will show up in how you deal with the people that your clients how who you're dealing with if you love what you do. And we are also a very open and transparent company so clients know exactly what they're paying for from the very start. Finally, it can be very financially rewarding. So the money that people can make, well into the six figures, in if they go to work for a company, I think that the last time I looked at what a creative director makes, it was around $250,000. So you can do what you love, you can work for someone else, if you don't want to be your own boss and take that risk, you can make money at it. And I think what's really important to this generation of students is, you can do something meaningful in the world, that you're not just doing it for the money. You can do something that can in some ways, it can change the world. So that's my advice. Information I'd like to pass on is that it can be an extremely rewarding career.

Interviewer  25:54  
And that's really great advice and all the work you're doing to help support our community too. I just want to thank you on behalf of me and all the other countless businesses out there that really appreciate what you're doing. And again, I'm speaking with Susan O'Connor Fraser with Tam Communications. I really appreciate you taking the time to answer some of my questions today.

Susan O'Connor Fraser  26:13  
Well, thank you. And if anybody wants to be in touch to learn anything more, they can connect with us through our website at tamcom.com. And myself or my husband or Reagan would be happy to answer any questions.
