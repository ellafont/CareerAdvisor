# INTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND
---

Jacob Sheckman : Hello and welcome everyone to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90. 7 FM. I'm Jacob Sheckman and you're listening to our show, What To Be, where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What to Be is a program provided by Your Future is Our Business, a Santa Cruz County non profit dedicated to helping students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, career panels, and other work based learning activities.

[00:01:00] Please note the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of Natural Bridges Media or Your Future is Our Business. The information provided during this program does not reflect this career in its entirety. And today I would like to say I'm joined by, but I think I'm actually joining Tom Amrein. Thanks for being here, Tom. 

Tom AmRhein : Thank you. Thanks for asking. 

Jacob Sheckman : Tom is here to talk to me today about his career as the vice president of Nature Ripe Berry Growers, and he's also the general manager at Elkhorn Berry Farms. Just to start off, I guess, clarify a little bit about what's the difference actually between these two companies that you're with? Are they separate companies? 

Tom AmRhein : Right. Well, these are obviously agricultural operations and one's a farming company and one's a grower shipper, a company that markets and sells the products. So, I'm in involved in both of them , but it's one, you know, one family of business. And my history goes back there, you know, 40 years ago when I started farming and I was a grower for, For Nature Ripe, which was a co [00:02:00] op, farmer's co op.

So, I had my farming operation and was on the board of directors and all that of Nature Ripe Berry Growers. And then Nature Ripe Berry Growers, the co op, as the times changed in different things in the economy and the structure of the food chain in the United States and tax laws and everything, it became a corporation.

So we turned ourselves into a corporation, so we were no longer co op members. We were shareholders of a corporation. And I happened to be in a position where I became a vice president of that corporation. And then at the same time, my own farming business transitioned into a larger, you know, as it grew from a family farming operation, it transitioned into a corporate operation that Elkhorn Berry Farm became a corporate entity within the, the larger umbrella. So, it's kind of the way farming has changed in the last 40 years. And it's pretty consistent with what happened to a lot of the farms.


# EARLY LIFE
---

Jacob Sheckman : You said that you started with nature at 40 years ago, what was your farming experience before getting to nature? 

Tom AmRhein : Well, I had just gotten out of [00:03:00] college, but that basically all I ever did was work around farming. You know, I had the practical skills, what I wanted to do. So, I'd worked on farms here in the Valley, which was more common, you know, you go back 40 or 45 years ago here in the Valley.

In the Pajaro Valley, if you could drive a vehicle, then you could get to work and even at pretty young age, right? I mean, 14 or 15, you're operating equipment and I was operating heavy equipment at 16 years old, like that was when we started on stuff like that.

Jacob Sheckman : Let's keep going further back then. How did you get into farming? Were your parents farmers? 

Tom AmRhein : No, so my Family was not, my dad was not, my parents were not in farming, but my dad came from a farming family. But he was, uh, that's getting back in time to where he got caught up in a world war II, and in the whole event and they were in the Midwest and of course then he got out in the Pacific and in the Navy and then came back to California and never went back to the farm in Indiana and then was able to get the GI bill, became a lawyer and stayed in Watsonville. So he really never left the West coast, but he [00:04:00] always wanted to be a farmer. And then there was family, there was farming in the family. So that was all part of the. 

Jacob Sheckman : Part of your introduction into it? Okay. And so you got into nature just after college?

Tom AmRhein : Yes. 


# SCHOOLING
---

Jacob Sheckman : Okay. And where did you go to school? 

Tom AmRhein : So, I went to college. I went to Cal Poly. I did two years , I didn't want to go to four year school. I just wanted to go farm. So I did two years at Hartnell and got a degree in Ag Mechanics and a degree in Crop Science. What they call AA degrees, right?

It got these two certificates, you know, and then I was working on a ranch down in the Salinas Valley. It was a pretty rough winter. And it was just miserable cold. And I was living in this, like a lion shack out on this ranch. And it was crazy, right.

Jacob Sheckman : What's the work that you're doing at this time? 

Tom AmRhein : That time it was an operation that had sugar beets and carrots and field crops. You know, it was big acreage down there, but it was kind of a miserable winter. And then one of my buddies I went to Cal Poly with, he, I mean, went to Hartnell with, he didn't want to go to Cal Poly and his family was pushing him too. He said, &quot;eh, well, we'll go down there. We'll try it for a [00:05:00] quarter,&quot; you know, which is like three months cause we're on a quarter system, you know, so, okay, we'll go down. And we tried it. And then we kept trying it and then we got done, you know, so I was only there six quarters, I mean, I was in and out.

Jacob Sheckman : So you started at Hartnell and eventually went to Cal Poly. 

Tom AmRhein : Yeah. 

Jacob Sheckman : Okay. 

Tom AmRhein : But Hartnell covered a lot of the ground for it. So, I wasn't at Cal Poly too long. I didn't take a long time to get the four year degree from them in farm management, which they don't even have that degree anymore. There's no such thing as a farm management degree. 

Jacob Sheckman : Just at Cal Poly?


# OLD FARMING 
---

Tom AmRhein : Or anywhere. Yeah. It's all moved on . It's got fancy names now. I don't know what it is. It's agricultural resource management or something, but the idea of a four year degree that was for people that were going to go back to a family farming operation, you know 

Jacob Sheckman : that wasn't common?

Tom AmRhein : That was very common then, I mean, the whole system, you know, their education was based around, but it's changed a lot since then because there's a family farms are different.

I always tell people I got a degree in farm management and we never took accrual accounting. It was all cash based accounting, which people don't even know what that is anymore, but all the family farms were on cash [00:06:00] basis. Right. So something as fundamental as a double entry accounting system really wasn't something that we even learned to really.

Jacob Sheckman : I have no idea what that is. 

Tom AmRhein : Yeah. I'd probably get in the weeds a little bit, but just an example of farming was still family. Small family operations, you know, a father, a son together, maybe, or a brother. The brothers would take it over and they'd farm, it was hands on. You know, at that time, we, you know, we didn't have cell phones, there was no internet. There wasn't computers. There was not computers out on the farms. We didn't have Personal computers yet, you know, and at time. They're just starting to come on board, you know, and I guess as soon as it got out, I got one. 

I had an old, cause I was all for the technology, but it was still all paper, you know, everything was done on paper. I go to Cal Poly back there every once in a while, they asked me to come down and talk to like a senior class. I'll bring my notebooks and everything is all written in by hand, all the graphing. We didn't even hardly use calculators. You had to be able to calculate and show your calculations and everything. 

Jacob Sheckman : Did you bring an abacus with you too? 

Tom AmRhein : Yeah. It's about, the way it was. Yeah. 


# CO-OPS
---

[00:07:00] 

Jacob Sheckman : So you talked about when you started with the Nature Ripe Berry Growers that it was a co op first, what exactly does it mean for it to be a co op farming operation?

Tom AmRhein : So co ops were prevalent in the ag industry because growers had a real hard time back in the, going back in history, like in the early 1900s, late 1800s, because of the railroads, the railroads were picking them clean because everything was transported by railroad and some little small grower out here somewhere trying to ship something on the railroad, you know, it was a mess.

And also the banks, they couldn't get financing. So then, federal government allowed for co ops, which was where you would be a cooperative organization and you wouldn't get hung up on any trust laws. People could band together and set prices and do a cooperative bidding for things like transportation and that sort of thing. So, that's what the co ops do. They provided the service of consolidating all the growers and they were purchasing agents for supplies. They could get a financing, like blocks of [00:08:00] financing, from the federal government and then operate as a bank, they could do that. 

So, it was for the old days of small independent family farms. It was a way for them to get together and market. 

Jacob Sheckman : And did Nature Ripe exist before you got there? 

Tom AmRhein : Oh yeah, and so Nature Ripe started in 1917. A lot of the Farm Bureau in the county here started in 1917. So, that was kind of the peak of the co op era is when it was really getting started and then it grew after that. You know, there's SunSweet, SunKissed, those are co op, well, Sunkist is still a co op on some suite. I'm not sure if that's still a co op, but CalAval, the big avocado group that was a co op. They're not anymore. Most of the co ops due to the conditions in the business and industry, in consolidation of the farms, they've turned into corporations owned by the growers. But, in some cases, they have outside shareholders as well now.

Jacob Sheckman : So for the most part, the ownership didn't necessarily change. It was more like on paper it was a different. 

Tom AmRhein : Yeah. The ownership didn't change, but co ops can't retain earnings. That's the problem with the co ops. Co op [00:09:00] has to return all the money back to the members every year. So, it's very difficult for co ops to capitalize a business cause they don't hold capital.

And people that, if they go to REI, that's a co op, right? You get a little co op dividend from like REI every year, right? If you'd buy anything there. So, that's a co op as well. And so, it doesn't retain profits and earnings. It tries to return everything back to the members.


# AFTER COLLEGE
---

Jacob Sheckman : And so, you get out of college. You show up at Nature Ripe, what is your position when you start with Nature Ripe? 

Tom AmRhein : Well, what happened was I got out of college, I decided I wanted to farm. I was going to farm, and it was what to farm, and I kind of had some ideas on that, and I decided that the best bet was strawberries. I could have done some other things, but okay, so I'm going to do strawberries, and then the question was, what's the best way to get a strawberry crop marketed?

There were some options, and then there was a farm, There was a family connection and I guess it kind of goes to, you talk about careers and business and how things work, there was a family connection in that, my [00:10:00] father had hired a young Japanese American out of law school in the early sixties. Which was very unusual, right? There wasn't any , in California and after the war and the internment and everything that happened with the Japanese Americans. There were very few of them, let's say, in law and those sort of things. 

So this young guy who came up from a Japanese American farming family in Watsonville and he became a lawyer. He goes to work for my dad. After that, there was a lot of trust between the families and they were a big family at Nature Rite. They were big growers, so they were a big part of the Nature Rite co op. And so they sponsored me into the co op.

You used to have to have a sponsor. You'd have to find one of the member families would have to say, &quot;okay, this person's okay. We should let him in,&quot; so that's how I got into Nature Rite. So, I was just a grower. We didn't have like, corporate offices or any officers or anything like that. So, I was just a grower and got elected to the board of directors and did all that for many years. 

Jacob Sheckman : After how long of being a grower?

Tom AmRhein : I don't know. I was pretty young when I got on the board. Yeah, I was pretty young when I got on the board. I don't know how old, it wasn't too many years after that.


# PRESENT DAY DETAILS 
---

Jacob Sheckman : Okay. So, let's [00:11:00] fast forward now to today where again, you're vice president at Nature Ripe and general manager for Elkhorn Berry farms. So, how would you describe your responsibilities today? What's your role within these two positions? 

Tom AmRhein : So, it's two completely different things, right? Cause one is a farming company, one is a really a product procurement company. And now we don't even have a sales company within Nature Rite Berry Growers Inc. Nature Rite Berry Growers Inc. owns another company called Nature Rite Farms, and that's the sales and marketing company.


# NATURE RITE BERRY GROWERS INC
---

Tom AmRhein : But the Nature Rite Berry Growers, Inc. is a company , so what we do is we provide product handling after it's harvested until the time the product's loaded on a reefer truck and being sent to market. So that's all the food safety work, which is a huge, tremendous, big department is all the food safety, making sure all the supply, all the growers that are growing for the label, the name, right? Nature Rite? Everything's done according to the law for food safety and all that. 

Then there's all of the crop [00:12:00] forecasting decisions about what varieties to plant, what to plant, when to plant, how much to plant. If there's new growers that want to come in, you know, do we want these growers or that grower should they have this many acres? Are we going to let them do this many acres? What do we need? So, there's that aspect of it. 

And then there's all of the cooling operations. So, all the cold chain management is within Nature Rite Berry Growers, Inc. So 

Jacob Sheckman : cold chain?

Tom AmRhein : Cold chain management. So, that's when the berry is harvested, it immediately has to be cooled down otherwise there's no shelf life, right? So you cool it down. So you have all these get it into the cooler. You're running in the big coolers, which if you're around Watsonville or down there on the industrial side of town or Salinas and where these big coolers are, you see all the reefer trucks in Watsonville, they have the refrigerated trucks. So, we have to cool the berries. 

Packaging procurement. All the packaging, we have to do all that. So, that's what Nature Rite Berry Growers, Inc. does and then we own this other company in conjunction with others. So, it's actually marketing. So, the guys that are actually talking to, [00:13:00] let's say, Costco every day there. They actually work for Nature Rite farms. So I'm at Nature Rite Berry Growers Inc and as a VP, so that it was mostly operational stuff. That was what I was handling, was things like the grower relations, the crop projections, the crop forecasting, plant procurement, the nurseries, all of the nursery stock that has to come in, that sort of thing.


# MEXICO
---

Tom AmRhein : And then I did, seven or eight years I spent setting up operations in Mexico because we expanded and actually had growers come into our deal in central Mexico. So, I was down in Mitchell Con in Wanawato, Jalisco. I spent years down there working on that. At the same time having this farming operation up here. So it did both, but that's a winner deal. So, I spent a lot of time down there and I'd already had experience doing business in Mexico from before, with cut flowers and some different things and was fluent in Spanish and all that and knew my way around Mexico already, central Mexico. 

And so, well, we did Baja as well. I did three years of stuff in Baja as well. So, I've been all over, Every [00:14:00] nook and cranny in Mexico, working on various over the years, you know. 

Jacob Sheckman : For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to What to Be at KSQD 90. 7 FM in Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob Sheckman and today we're speaking with Tom Amraheim and learning about his career journey to becoming the vice president of Nature Ripe Berry Growers.

And the general manager at Elkhorn Berry Farms. Can you talk about some of the interactions that you might have on any given day? Do you go to an office?


# DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
---

Tom AmRhein : I don't, I actually have two offices, a corporate office and a farm office and they're in two different locate, onces in the farm where the farm is here, and then the corporate office is in Salinas. That's a different building and when I'm down there, I'm doing that, and when I'm over here, I'm doing the other. 

But typical day, well, they're not really typical, but, yesterday, I mean, at six o'clock in the morning, I get a phone call. All of the scanners are down. We can't upload to put payroll scanners for the [00:15:00] crews or not. They won't start. They won't start up. So you got 500 people out there, however many, hundreds of people out there, standing around ready to go to work and harvest and the payroll system's crashed and we can't get it to boot up and so there's this mad scramble to get out paper and start doing it on paper until we could get that going, so that happened yesterday.

And then, we're dealing with COVID. So I spent probably a couple hours yesterday working on the COVID deal. Talking to other people in the industry. I had a town hall meeting with one of the supervisors in the county, and I was on that for an hour talking about agriculture's response to COVID. What else happened yesterday?

I sold a couple of used tractors that we had that we didn't need, dealt with that. It's just a real, it's just everything, all kinds of stuff goes on. Looking at quality, talking to the pesticide guys and the fertilizer guys and those sort of things and planning the week. Planning what's going to happen here because of this heat. See, it got real hot. So, you have to think about that. You have to think about how long is the crew going to be able to work [00:16:00] today before the heat rules about not working when it's too hot and do we have enough people? 

Jacob Sheckman : What's your planning process like? Like, were you checking the weather a few days ago, trying to get ahead and what else are you doing to get ready for a week?

Tom AmRhein : Well, the main thing you're always doing is you're always checking the weather. And then the other thing you're always looking at is labor supply. You know, how many people should we have? How many do we have? How many people are showing up to get to work or asking for work? 

Right now I spend a lot of time on COVID, is there anybody sick? Does anybody know anybody that's sick? Where are we at on that? Are the people wearing it, face masks? Are they social distancing out in the field, that kind of thing. There's always that. 


# HANDLING COVID 
---

Jacob Sheckman : Has Nature Rite been able to procure any test kits or anything? Is that an option? 

Tom AmRhein : No, it's a pretty complex setup of how it's being managed and it's being managed under a, CDC order, it's very systematic what you do and when you do it and those sorts of things, but yeah, we don't do any like on farm testing or anything like that.

Yeah. And then there's all [00:17:00] of the confidentiality for health records. Right. So there's a whole, it's very complex, but you know, we're working through it and there's very little problem with it. They really don't see any transmission of disease in like an open field crew. It's not being transmitted outside.

Jacob Sheckman : So the tasks that you've gone over in the last five minutes which extensive to say the least is that just more so for your position as VP? Or is 

Tom AmRhein : That was just a farm. That's just farm. 

Jacob Sheckman : Oh, that's just for as GM. 


# VICE PRESIDENT RESPONSIBILITIES 
---

Tom AmRhein : That's just on the general. Yeah, that would be the farm side. The other, the more corporate he will say, like you say, VP, what's a VP?

Well, that would be more like doing the roundtable with the supervisor. Industry representation, you could say that, yeah, I was working on some land leases for other areas in the company. I was doing that yesterday, working with some landlords on some stuff, that wouldn't pertain to the farm, but would more apply to the company as a whole, those kinds of things.

[00:18:00] Looking at some of the pest and disease trends across the state. What's happening up in the nurseries, tracking that. That's kind of the more corporate side of it, those kinds of things. 

So we do all that and then you've got, of course, you got all the financial side of it, right? You have to be watching your costs and cost per unit and all that kind of stuff that goes on. Financial statement side of it too. 


# MISC
---

Jacob Sheckman : Yeah. So you are literally all over the place. 

Tom AmRhein : Yeah, it's you're in every aspect of it and the only thing I don't do anymore is basically drive a tractor, but 

Jacob Sheckman : Do you miss driving the tractor?

Tom AmRhein : Um, yeah, I mean, I do. I still keep a little bit around the house that I can fill around with, but just to say I do it, but the big farming, you know, everything now is an expertise, right? So even those guys, I can't, the larger tractors now with all the technology, and I can't drive them, I don't know how to drive them, you know?

And I used to do all my own tillage work. I would do a lot of, I mean, I started out operating equipment, right? But by the time the operation got large enough and I got more as a management, even when I was an owner, I don't have time to learn how to drive those things, you know, the [00:19:00] younger guys love it. So, put them on there and let them go. I'm jealous.


# COLLEGE
---

Jacob Sheckman : So I wanted to go back to ask about your decision making when it came to college. How at first you said you didn't want to go to four year, but you did say that it was more common at that time for someone to go to a four year and then go into farming. 

Tom AmRhein : Uh, no. I guess a better way to say it is I wanted to farm. Wasn't that I didn't want to go to school, I wanted to farm. School was like a waste of time at that point. Particularly the well established family farms in California, those kids, mostly all of them went to college cause that's the only time they'd get off the farm basically. I mean, they joke about it, but you kind of went to Cal Poly to get married, because you were going to go back to Brawley or Porterville or Siskiyou County or something and you weren't leaving. 

Yeah. You weren't leaving and that's where you spent the rest of your life, and that's different now. It's all changed. It's a lot more fluid and whatnot in the industry now. 

Jacob Sheckman : So, you first went to Hartnell and you were reluctant you and your friend to go to Cal Poly, but what was it again that ultimately pushed you guys to say, &quot;we'll, go just go for a quarter?&quot;

Tom AmRhein : Yeah, [00:20:00] it's just, you know, between family pressure and other friends were going. Eh, okay, you know, well, let's go see, you know, and then that was the thing. It seemed like it, cause it wasn't working. If you weren't like physically working, you were lazy. So school was kind of like, eh, eh, it's kind of. It was like not working. 

Jacob Sheckman : From my perspective, I feel like you went to Cal Poly with a slight reluctance, but then you just stuck it out. There was something that you had to push yourself to get through this 'cause you didn't, did you like it?

Tom AmRhein : Well, once I got there, I liked it. 

Jacob Sheckman : Okay. 

Tom AmRhein : And actually, I believe if you look back, I think I had a top GPA in the whole school of ag when I graduated. So, I was like top of the class when I graduated, but that'd be competitive cause then I was going to work, right? 

Jacob Sheckman : So that's what it was, when you showed up, you said, &quot;okay, well, here's the work now and I'm going to do it well.&quot;

Tom AmRhein : Yeah. And I just pounded. And I'm going to get out of here. I'm going to get it done. I'm going to get it done right. And then I'm going and I'm out, you know. 


# WORK ETHIC
---

Jacob Sheckman : So, what do you think helped you build that mentality of this work ethic. I've known you for a long time, you've always had this, this [00:21:00] incredible work ethic.

Tom AmRhein : That's just, well, I suppose probably someone who's genetic. Some of it's probably not healthy to be like too much. Some of it's cultural. That's just what you're expected to do in our family. And, you know, their history and where they came from and they're Germanic, and it was all about work, right? You worked. And you had skill sets to, you know, that was the other thing to be able to do things. 

Which meant like you need to be able to fix a car, right? You didn't want to like, it was like you failed if you had to take your car to a mechanic, right? You should be able to fix it yourself. It probably made it worse. But those kinds of things, that's how it was. That's how I was raised. That's how the family was. You did everything. You learned to do it yourself. You didn't depend on others to do it for you.

And you shouldn't pay somebody to do it. That was like, no, you know. You shouldn't have to pay somebody like fix your car. 

Jacob Sheckman : Right. If it's something you can do yourself, why pay for it? 

Tom AmRhein : Yeah. But that's old school and that's all changed, you know, now, and I don't even abide by that because you know, it's good to let other people work too. In other words, that's fine. Something needs to be [00:22:00] fixed, I'll pay the man to fix it because he's got to make a living too. I can do something else with that time 


# REACTIONS TO NEW BEGINNINGS 
---

Jacob Sheckman : Interesting. Was there anything that was surprising maybe when you showed up to Hartnell or Cal Poly or when you started at the Nature Rite co op?

Tom AmRhein : Well, I suppose, if you get into the whole career thing or career pathway or whatever life pathway, I would say the main thing is, you know, there's certainly been these transitions we'll say, or through this time, and very abrupt, right? I mean, there's been some financial disasters and, then you didn't know what was next, right?

It's just, oh man, now you're backs to the wall. What's gonna happen? And then it, and I would say it never turned out for the worst. Always turned out for the best. I never had like a catastrophic event that didn't, even though it meant I had to make, you know, just the idea that I moved from an independent family farmer to a corporate structure. 

I mean, that in and of itself was like huge, right? It's gigantic. That's almost a heretical, it was [00:23:00] like, you kind of break in with your own rules cause it's kind of the corporate not good. I'm a family farmer, but make those decisions and then different thing, and things work out. Yeah. You can't be afraid to take the leap, you know. 

Jacob Sheckman : Did any of that at any point feel overwhelming?

Tom AmRhein : Yeah, sure. Of course. Yeah. I mean, eh, overwhelming, eh. 

Jacob Sheckman : Maybe not that experience specifically, but.

Tom AmRhein : Well, I wouldn't say any of it's, you can be overwhelmed by circumstance. Like the flower business, we were overwhelmed and basically between two things that just really destroyed it was our bill. That was a great business too, but, NAFTA, the NAFTA treaty, the free trade treaty, and then 9 11. Between those two events and we were done. And it had to do with changes in the economy in the importation of flowers. And then it had to do with, at that time when lockdown of the transportation system and everything that happened after that. Just at that time and after was when the whole Amazon type thing was starting to get going and the E Trade and all that.

That really, we really got whacked hard on that deal. So yeah, I [00:24:00] could see be overwhelmed with events, but then it was like, okay, this ain't working. 

Jacob Sheckman : What do we do now? 

Tom AmRhein : And yeah, and we can worry about it and drown, or we can make a decision to start swimming and figure it out and you just do it little by little, you just have to do it, just do what you have to do, and just keep plugging away till you get it, you know? So that's how it's been. Well, a lot of times it's just that, you just do today what you can do. You can't worry about the rest, you know? 

Jacob Sheckman : Excellent advice. All right, Tom. Thanks for talking to me today. I really appreciate it. All right, and thank you to all of our listeners for tuning in to today's career story.
