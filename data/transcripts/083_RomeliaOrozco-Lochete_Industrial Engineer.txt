Today, I'm excited to be joined by our guest, Romelia Orozco-Lochte. Thanks so much for being here, Romelia.


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  1:07  
Oh, thank you. My pleasure. 


Interviewer  1:08  
Yeah, my pleasure as well. Romelia is here to talk to us about her very interesting career history. She got really into industrial engineering and was able to take her experiences to apply them in different fields. Romelia, can you tell us a little about your work history and education, and how you got into the field of engineering?


#EDUCATION AND EARLY CAREER
Romelia Orozco-Lochte  1:49  
Well, everything begin. Like every kid, I guess, we alert, confused, all stressed out, because you have to define what are you going to do for a living and in the way your parents and teachers presented? You're going to be literally forever being whatever is the did you decide that? I don't know. 1617? So what I did, I went to an assessment, and does aptitude assessment. The lady came out with architecture, or engineering. So the confusion still there? I mean, what kind of engineering they're like 800 Millions of choices. 


So she started going from some of them, the ones that she thought that I was kind of build up for, I guess, and she was gonna mechanical, and I cannot I don't believe so. Surrounded by ugly guys full of grease. Smelling No. Chemistry. I was gonna I don't think so. Everything is exploding. Everything smells bad. No. So I mean, she keeps on going until she finally says, well, it is one career that is starting. It is kind of Berlin, you what have you. I sent to Sterling engineering. So it's kind of okay, tell me about it. So, in the way he presented it, it was two branches of it. You can go either administration or mechanical, and rivalries whenever it got my attention because administration, it was the high heels, the good looking the what have you, right? Not sweating.Everything was just perfect. So I went into that 


Everything was hard. Everything, you have all the calculus, equations, all kinds of horrible things. From their own, as soon as I finally convinced myself, I'm not going to do this for a living, I just need to pass them. From there. Everything changed. My attitude changed absolutely everything I studied, just pass them. And whenever it was, I'm gonna say but the fourth semester, third semester, everything changed. Because it was more into the industrial engineering. It was in through the optimization, and the planning of vacation, the the things that I just love the most. So from there on, it was fantastic. I was excelling. Everything was wonderful. 


I remember a project we needed to go to literally to production and swap factory and let's see what you come up with. So we got my friend and I we got a gig and the guy was just kind of stay there. Do whatever he said that you're gonna do. Just do not bother any of the employees and workers. 


Interviewer  4:57  
He said they said this to you. 


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  4:58  
Yes. So it was like a entertain yourself. I'm doing this because the wife of my husband did it. Bla bla bla is asking me for a favor. Miss Khanna, thank you very much we appreciate that we just need to be, I mean, we need the grade, right? So we started looking how the production line was, what were the needs of these. I mean, they were not even needs because the owner didn't, he didn't ask literally for anything. 


So we started applying every single detail that we have learned in different sections, different semesters, different subjects. And we end up after I'm gonna say poor weeks, we ended up optimizing and raising, the production for 33%. 


Interviewer  5:51  
Oh, my gosh, 


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  5:52  
sit, the guy was flipped. We were smiling. We didn't calculate the 33% he came out with it. We just knew that we needed to change the layout, we need to put this guy over here. This guy is pushing himself to attach these parts with the other one. The other one is a natural one. So we our proposal was making all those changes with almost no embarrassment to the guy who was just going crazy. Needless to say, I was going crazy, because finally I got literally the passion. What do I want it to do? It was like breathing, just oxygen. It was wonderful to feel that I made somebody else's life easier. Workers. 


Interviewer  6:45  
It was in that that project that you did, that's when you first really felt that like, oh my gosh, I love this. 


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  6:53  
Yes, I just loved this subject. But I never, I mean, everything was theory. So whenever I applied all of it, I realized this is what really is my calling. From that point on, it was clear. Then I graduated. For whatever reason, I graduated before I was 21. My mother got me another gig immediately. So I was in this factory. The same thing, they just gave me a desk. It was the son of somebody's friend, so we were like puppets in the middle of the office.And he was some assign it a segment, I had a corporate once a manual of what we do in production in this building. Sounds good. So I started designing my forms. I started making appointments with every single employee. Needless to say, I mean, 21 year old woman engineer, we were three in the in the whole class. 


Interviewer  8:03  
How big was the class? 


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  8:05  
We were about 30 something. It was a private university. Again, it was just starting the career, the name of the industrial and system engineering. From there on, it was nothing but, "Sure, yes, I can wait for you, sir. You told me 9:00, now it's 9:30," and I had to smile and keep on waiting. Finally, the forms, the questions I was asking, started getting their attention. Everybody spread the word, "This girl is not wasting our time."


So I ended up after it was the typical three month manual Amin project, I ended up with a good size manual. And the same thing I started putting together what this apartment does what the other one does, what they're coming up with. Surprise these guys over here is typing the same information that the other one on this side. The other one is typing who knows what to get the same information. It was like a little chain reaction, putting all the pieces together to have the whole vision of it.


So in that three month project ended up being like about 16 months and now organize this now create a chart for this. So it was little patches that I really enjoyed. I never pay attention about those 16 months after I finish everything and we are not going to you're not going to be an employee. You have always been a contractor from their own, I went to these little firm, but that time I kinda kinda had a name and a to manage this little company. They used to sail install phones, all kinds the system that you can have, whenever they started that it was not rotary anymore, which was humongous, huge phones that had three different lines. Now they were compact, they came from all kinds of everywhere on Earth. And I was just managing this and I just keep on looking at the guys who salespeople. This one was the biggest company in the state. So they were just making money. Nobody had that. The inventory that this guy had, nobody had. So they were just making money. So I was kind of you know what, I think I want money too. So I started as a salesman, saleswoman, and everything, again, came natural. I have no idea of one of my first loving subjects in industrial engineering was industrial psychology. I loved it. I loved it, I have always been a people person. So now I had the tool in how to approach people and get the information I need.


#PROFESSIONAL JOURNEY
Interviewer  11:43  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to what to be at ks QD 90.7 FM in Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob Schekman. And today we're speaking with Romelia Orozco-Lochte and learning about her career journey to becoming an industrial engineer. How long were you working at as in engineering, or an engineering position before you decided that you wanted to try and become going to sales?


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  12:09  
It was about four years. 


Interviewer  12:12  
Okay. 


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  12:13  
It was really fast. 


Interviewer  12:17  
Yeah, 


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  12:17  
It was really fast. I didn't make all the money. I didn't get the brand new car, anything like that. I was just enjoying myself. I was toying and creating. It was wonderful, but I wasn't making much So until I get exposed with these people, let's connect, I can make that much money. And out of nowhere, I started thank goodness excelling again, in sales. Because my engineering vocabulary, and because the, I want to think that psychology also helped. So it was, I mean, from nothing, I went to talk with the owners of huge factories, I started talking with the managers, general managers, CFOs, all kinds of different huge meetings, how much are we gonna invest? Where we're gonna do everything. 


So in one of those projects, it was one of the biggest ones in an international company, these guy, they already bought everything from me. And now we have all the layout of the company is gonna, where we're gonna use, how are we going to install these wires where everything is gonna go? So we keep on talking? And then out of nothing? He's asking me, Why do you speak like that? So it's gonna do everything is in Spanish? I have no clue. I mean, no accent? No, nothing. You didn't even know what he meant at the time. No, I literally asked him, What are you talking about? And he was can I guess you're using this terminology and what have you. It's gonna I'm an industrial engineer. And he was kind of what are you doing doing this? Of course, I didn't say making plenty of money. I was just kind of this is what I'm doing. I'm enjoying it. I'm talking to different people. 


And so I didn't say that I was getting fed up with traffic with not having a schedule. It was at whatever time they had to be is a humongous contract. So it doesn't matter. They are installing the whole equipment. They didn't finish on Saturday. Oh, so you have to go and supervise on Sunday. So it was just it started getting kinda Yeah. And that was one of the things that I was so successful because I will personally go and check everything single detail. Again, part of the industrial engineer, you are closing the circle you implement everything that you just optimized. He offer me a job, right on the spot. And he was gonna how much money do you want? And I told him how much I was making and he was like  Now am I gonna drop out of my chart? And I was kind of I know. And he offered me the top he can extra bonuses, what have you, I stayed there. And is whenever he wanted me to start with a project, we, it was everything about inventory warehouse, the warehouse was huge. It was material everywhere. It was just like, disasters, it was for me, it was just horrible to see, for whatever reason, I have been always kinda order.


Interviewer  16:06  
so it was just  really disorganized, like, there was just nothing had an order to it, 


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  16:10  
nothing had an order, it was like, they started putting together different air conditioning systems. And they have different parts. So it was kind of okay, all the inventory was put all the parts of this specific air conditioning unit, they're going to be here or is gonna do it, they use the same, I don't know conductor than the other one. And you have conductors here, and conductors there. So again, put everything exactly like my second project, whatever I think together, map it all, and come out with the conclusion, this is double, this is triple this is an optimize the whole thing. The whole area shrunk, maybe a third, from where it was. Everybody knew not just the the warehouse guy, everybody knew where to find something. Everything was. I mean, I was very, very proud of it. Everybody was very proud of it as well, you will have the CFO and the CEO, bringing people from another countries and look at our warehouse and look at this, it was awesome. Then eight would came a different project. And it came on different project time passes by. And I heard about these very well known guy. And he was opening his own consulting firm. So I was kinda sweet. Let me go and talk to him. But that time, I had been trained to be working just with guys. It was offered up, or you're gonna quit. So I was just kinda I can manage this. And sure enough, he gave me the management of the SAP firm. It was a small firm, we're about 37, from programming people to consultants, you have PhDs masters, all kinds of people. So again, time passes by, I came to this country to do the same thing.In that time, I met my husband, we got married, we had two kids. And now that the kids are just old enough to be thriving and doing everything, their lives and what have you. I started doing it, I started a different project. I'm a certified life coach. And it is the same concepts.


What is it that you have? How are you gonna make your life better? And stress management, time management, finances, all kinds of different things that goes in one person's life? How do you want to make your life better? So and where are you? So we go back to the same thing. Here is where we are. Let's see how can we make this better? More stress management, more human, of course, psychology, ADHD, dyslexia, all kinds of different concepts to come out with the same thing. Better do a better product. So I love it. No regrets whatsoever of the industrial engineering at all. 


Interviewer  19:58  
I love your story. I really I really do. I think you're an inspiring individual. So but I'm gonna get hung up on this, I have, I've met many questions for you. But as, as you've been telling me your story, I've been writing down some words, and that I think just describe you in a very positive light. And I have a humble, resilient, ambitious, curious and tough. And there are others that I'm sure I just didn't write down. But these traits that you have, they seem like things that you've developed along your throughout your life, but that are natural to you, you, you didn't learn how to be tough, you are tough, you are curious, you are ambitious. So I'm curious where some of that might have come from when you were growing up. Because the perspective that you grew up with is so far from from my own, that it's hard for me to put myself in your shoes. And so when I try, I can only imagine how incredibly difficult it would be to to be in your shoes as a as a woman surrounded by all these men. We before we started recording, I mentioned the what you had written to me how when you went to work, you went to work managing at the warehouse, and people place bets as to how long you would last. And you You knew about this, but you you didn't you don't acknowledge it to them, you don't tell them you're working your tail off, you just do your work. And there's so there's, I feel like there's so much to that that's amazing that you didn't, you didn't go out of your way to to say something to these men to show you didn't show off to them. You just did your job. And you did it so successfully, that they eventually let it go. You were number one in your company. So I just I want to know more about your except maybe your upbringing, where where does this strength come from in you? 


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  21:58  
I have no idea. I grow up. My mother was single mother, she work your tail off for nothing to be missing. I guess that was part of it. It was just in me. I remember. I mean, as I mentioned, I'm dyslexic. So I need to pass anthropology. Don't ask me why anybody will think about anthropology as a class to be an engineer. So I have to read everything, like good 100 times. Besides getting bored, and then the dislikes, it was horrible. So I remember my mother, I tried every single different approach to study, all my friends, some of them didn't sleep all all night. And other ones went to sleep early and get up in the middle of the night. And other ones. Everybody had their own style. So I tried to figure it out which one was mine. Of course, without knowing the dyslexia that was not a thing those days. 


I remember one night, I went to the early, I get up at three in the morning, and I'm starting and my mother comes out they're separating okay, because of course the lamp was on. And I was gonna Yes, I'm just trying to pass love of God. And she was kidnapped. You know? What? If you can't, is okay. It is a lot of things that you can do. So it's gonna allow me to put my gloves on. This is not going to break me. So I went on and on. And I, at some point, I never noticed that. I never pay attention to it. And tea to that conversation. That third series can add how much time do you give this woman? We broke the other one within three months? How long is this one going to last? So needless to say my gloves came out. I was gonna have for you. So far, he finally gave me the report. He did not give me the updated report. So I was gonna you know what I don't care can manage. So I went to another channel and I got the information. So I mean, it. I have no idea from where all these courage came. It was just like you said it was a natural thing. It just came. It just came out.


Interviewer  24:42  
Okay, Romania, we have maybe just a couple more minutes, but I have two more questions for you. The first one, what advice do you have for for any of our listeners regarding something you think that might be helpful for them as they're just trying to figure out you know what What should i What should I do? What What should I love? How should they go about trying to find a career doing something that they love? 


#ADVICE TO LISTENERS
Romelia Orozco-Lochte  25:10  
I strongly believe in that assessment. That open. I mean, it was like they were reading me. I didn't know that about me. I knew that I liked Legos. But I didn't know that it was a suggestion. You can make a career out of architecture. It was somebody who studied that has the license, the power of telling me this, right now it is a lot of apps that give you the information, try different ones. There are all kinds that from the most ridiculous ones, to another ones that they are formal, do just try each of them. Do they have something? Are they telling you something in common? Go from there, have a lot of quiet time, don't go to the screen. Whenever it is, you have to have a quiet time, you have to understand you have to go who you are. Go back to the pencil, the boxes pencil, everything has to be organized. No, I didn't care at all. I love cooking. And I love putting what have you, whenever you do something that comes natural to you. It is a pleasure to do it. And on top of that, you get paid for 


be resilient. You have no idea how horrible it was to study calculus, calculus 123 a differential equation, I can keep on going dynamics. And again, point of view, I just have to pass them. Everybody was going through the same struggle. How do you take the situation is what makes a difference? We all are gonna trip. But we have to get up. You're on the floor already. You already trip? How far can you go. So do just do not have a choice, but even crawl or get up. So everybody has a choice and every single moment. And the resilience is the one that is gonna make you get up. The resilience is the one that is going to take you tell you this app, it doesn't make any sense. The result doesn't make any sense. Let's try another one. And let's try another one. Until it makes sense to you. 


Interviewer  27:38  
Beautiful. I have one more question. But a similar I suppose now I'm hoping you can direct some advice to young women, young girls who are trying to go into male dominated fields, engineering sciences, whatever, what what advice do you have for these young women to help build any resilience that they may need?


Romelia Orozco-Lochte  28:04  
Well, dad is one of the maybe the must the factor that helped me the most, I am different. I am not like them, and I am not going to be following them. To put me down, I come back with the double of force. Don't quit. That is your dream. It is your dream. You're not gonna give away your dream. That's why it's called your dream. Go for it. It is for you. Go for it. You're gonna. You're always going to struggle. Even nowadays, an industrial engineer woman, it has to work as twice as a guy. It doesn't change. It hasn't change. But if you if it is your natural call, you're going to fail. It is not doubt.
