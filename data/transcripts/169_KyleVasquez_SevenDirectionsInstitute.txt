# INTRODUCTION


Interviewer  0:17  
Hello and welcome everyone to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and you're listening to our show What To Be, where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What To Be, as a program provided by Your Future Is Our Business at Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through college, through programs such as college and career expos, panels, and other work based learning activities. Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of natural bridges media, or Your Future Is Our Business. The information provided during this program does not reflect its career in its entirety. And today, I have the pleasure to speak to Kyle Vasquez, who is the owner and director of Seven Directions Institute. Hi, Kyle.


Kyle Vasquez  1:02  
Hi.


Interviewer  1:02  
Hi, thank you so much for coming down to the station and being a guest on the show tonight. I really appreciate you being here.


Kyle Vasquez  1:07  
It's a pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me.


Interviewer  1:09  
Right on. Kyle, would you please describe your career journey for us?


Kyle Vasquez  1:14  
It's a big, convoluted career journey. Yeah, I've just become the owner and director of Seven Directions Institute of Art and Science, which is kind of a Santa Cruz staple. They've been here for over 20 years through four different owners. And I just kind of took over the mantle. My path to getting there. I kind of feel like my path to getting there started when I was a small child and kind of everything I've been doing up until now has led me here. I studied early childhood education in college and really developed this love of teaching kids and helping kids learn to love learning and how to communicate with each other and value themselves and value each other and value the world and nature. And then that led me to being a nature educator as well. I work with BOD Forest School, which is a homeschool program that meets in the forest and works with different groups of kids. One day a week. I started teaching mindfulness and yoga for kids about a decade ago and in different preschools and in different public schools here and there and everywhere. I was a professional artist and muralist. I've kind of just been like Jill of all trades, I got diagnosed as ADHD last year. And so it kind of makes sense, right? Like, I get bored if I do the same thing too long. So I've kind of been doing like little bits of all these different things. But everything kind of comes down to me like I love kids. I love teaching. I love nature. And I love anything that's creative. So I feel like it's all kind of just culminated here at this place that lets me do art, do science, work with kids, teach mindfulness and do a little bit of everything.


Interviewer  3:18  
Well, congratulations on becoming the owner of Seven Directions Institute.


Kyle Vasquez  3:22  
Thank you.


Interviewer  3:22  
Yeah, that's really awesome. And thank you for all the work that you've done to, you know, to make our community a better place and to help the youth. I think that's so needed.


Kyle Vasquez  3:31  
Thank you. Yeah.


Interviewer  3:32  
And especially kind of like the direction that you follow.


Kyle Vasquez  3:38  
Yeah, I think I think it's such a powerful thing that we overlook a lot in our culture that, you know, teaching kids how to be in the world and how to, you know, have self worth and interact with other humans and think creatively, like, I don't know, we think about like test scores and all this stuff, but we don't spend enough time educating ourselves on just how to exist and how to enjoy life and be kind to each other.


# EARLY LIFE


Interviewer  4:05  
That's great. And I think you told me before the interview that you're from Santa Cruz?


Kyle Vasquez  4:09  
Born and raised. I managed to move away for six months once to Monterrey and then I came back.


Interviewer  4:18  
And you spent some time at Cabrillo College?


Kyle Vasquez  4:20  
Yes, I have my degree in early childhood education from Cabrillo College.


Interviewer  4:23  
Very cool. Yeah, great. The best junior college right?


Kyle Vasquez  4:26  
It's the best college my son has just started. He's 16. He's taking his first class and Cabrillo right now and I'm so proud.


Interviewer  4:32  
I started last week. Yes, very cool. Yeah, it's exciting.


Kyle Vasquez  4:36  
It's very exciting.


Interviewer  4:37  
Yeah, I think I told you about my friend Pace McNatt who teaches all kinds of interesting like art. Yes. You know, you know if your son's ever interested in taking an art class, their Pace's a great guy.


Kyle Vasquez  4:47  
I keep telling him to take everything you can while you're in high school just because every class I ever took at Cabrillo was amazing. Every teacher I ever had was just a remarkable wonderful human.


Interviewer  4:57  
I feel the same way. Yeah, I feel indebted to Cabrillo for making me come back to school. just such an amazing experience. Yes. And feeling like they genuinely cared.


Kyle Vasquez  5:07  
Yeah, I get a little on my high horse because everyone kind of feels like people talk down about junior colleges sometimes and I'm like, okay, but Cabrillo rails the best school ever don't talk about Gabriella. Okay.


# NBOG


Interviewer  5:19  
Do you want to share with us a little bit more about NBOG? And you know, because of the last few years, you know, there were a lot of different things happening. Did a school like that see, like, you know, maybe an influx of people may be wanting their children to attend a school maybe more something like that?


Kyle Vasquez  5:41  
Yes, absolutely. And actually, I know, there's been, you know, and NBOG, where I've been teaching, has existed for almost 20 years. And we've been doing this for a really long time. And then when the pandemic happened, all of a sudden, there's like, many, many more nature groups in Santa Cruz, which is wonderful. Kids should be outdoors learning in nature, there's so many benefits to it. But yeah, we definitely saw more students and kind of different kinds of students, because we're traditionally a homeschool program. So historically, we kind of get a certain group of families who are homeschooling and value being in nature enough to spend like a whole day, every week, just out in the woods, even if it's raining, even if it's cold, we're out there. So it kind of brings a certain demographic, but one of the cool things about the pandemic was, we got to see families who were maybe homeschool families, but couldn't handle being on the computer all day every day. So I needed something else to kind of alleviate that, and ways that felt safer to be in groups and connect with other people. And, and I think a lot of us just kind of forgot how to be with other people for a certain period of just being alone in our houses with our immediate families. And yeah, it was interesting kind of having the job of helping parents as well as kids kind of relearn how to be a community. And one of the things that we always say makes NBOG different from a lot of other forest schools or nature programs is one of our biggest goals is building community, because so often homeschool families are kind of existing in their own little vacuum. So our job is to help you make a bigger family within the community. So and then kids who were very young, I was working with five year olds who, you know, maybe can't even really remember times before in the before times, and then helping them kind of figure out how to be social for the first time it was, it was very interesting, as a teacher, academically, I was like, this is fascinating look at these children, but also just really beautiful to just watch people kind of like, like, breathe and open up. And nature just says that to us anyway, you know?


Interviewer  8:03  
Yeah, when you're, there's something about when you're not in the four walls, you know, that you can breathe a little bit deeper. And the words you can express yourself may be a little bit easier. And it's great that, you know, a school like that exists, you know, because it's critical, right? There's so much development happening like at those young ages, for them to not be isolated and to be amongst peers, and you know, to have, you know, people like you there to help, you know, guide that.


Kyle Vasquez  8:30  
Yeah, absolutely. Well, and you know, we find a lot of, you know, a lot of kids who are neurodivergent do better in an outdoor setting, because the stimuli are different. And you can just kind of relax into things. And just, you know, we live in such a digital era, which, you know, I'm not one of those people that would be like, kids should never look at screens, I think there's value to all of it. But there's such a reward and just spending like, one full day every week, like, you know, disconnecting from the digital and being, you know, grounded into the earth being barefoot on soil and breathing and like the smell of the forest after it rains, you know, every day that I'm like, Oh, I'm tired. I don't want to go to work. And then I do and I'm like, oh, nevermind. I feel amazing. Now. That was great. Yeah.


Interviewer  9:14  
It is kind of like a mind, body, soul, kind of like empowerment.


Kyle Vasquez  9:19  
The whole thing.


Interviewer  9:20  
What's NBOG stand for?


Kyle Vasquez  9:22  
Nature Based Ongoing Group.


Interviewer  9:24  
Okay. And you said they've existed a long time in Santa Cruz?


Kyle Vasquez  9:27  
Yeah. Just about 20 years, I believe. Founded by a group of homeschool parents whose homeschool program was closing and asked a couple of teachers they knew, like, can you just keep teaching our kids and we don't have a building. So let's just go outside.


# ART AND THEATER EXPERIENCE


Interviewer  9:42  
Very cool. Do you want to talk about you know, you're an artist too. And you know, you're part of the theater here in Santa Cruz. You want to talk about your theater background?


Kyle Vasquez  9:49  
Sure. My theater background starts at the age of three. I started doing theater when I was three and from then on I think I did like at least two I was every year my whole childhood. Up until I was 18. I thought I was going to go to college for theater. I got into some fancy drama schools in Hollywood and then went to Hollywood and realized I'm not really a city person. And I didn't think I would spiritually survive in that kind of Hollywood environment. So I stopped doing theater for a long time. And then just kind of refound it as my son became a teenager and fell in love with theater. And it was like, oh, yeah, this is my love, too. So yeah, I've been working at all about theater for a handful of years now and directing Youth Theatre. We do musicals for five through 18 year olds. And then we just start doing dramas again. We have a drama coming up. The shows will be the 14th and 15th of October at the actor's theater.


Interviewer  10:53  
Very cool.


Kyle Vasquez  10:53  
Yeah.


Interviewer  10:54  
So do you want to tell people where the actor's theater is where the shows are?


Kyle Vasquez  10:57  
The actors, there's where the shows are. The show is called Trap. It's a kind of mystery thriller. It's going to be very exciting. Yeah, we also have Peter Pan as auditioning, shout out to all about theater. Peter Pan's auditioning next week, we've got Seussical, about to start, and then I'm directing into the woods in late October, the shows will be in February. So all about theater is a fantastic funded organization. They've been here for almost 20 years, everything is almost 20 years in my life. That's weird. Just realize that but yeah, another great program, just saying like, the arts are important. And kids need these things in their lives to be well rounded people who love themselves and love each other. And, you know, we focused on not just putting on great show, but helping kids and their best selves.


Interviewer  11:44  
Yeah. And I think there's something to be said, for doing the uncomfortable, right? Stepping outside, you know that. And that seems to be like, speaking for myself, that's like, where growth tends to happen?


Kyle Vasquez  11:56  
Absolutely. And I think any kind of arts, you do have to have that in them, right? Like, you could be the best artists in the world. And if you just keep doing the same paintings, they become dead, like, you have to push yourself into those scary zones to be successful in any kind of art. And I think that's so good for us.


Interviewer  12:15  
I just finished taking the summer session art, drawing and painting class. And I've never really drawn before and they're like, it's a five week class in the first two weeks, I'm like, I made a mistake, just give me a book and a paper to write. But, you know, after like, weeks, three through five, like I really started finding a rhythm and finding kind of that flow state. And it was, you know, it's like, therapeutic. Yeah. And being able to express yourself and seeing stuff come out, like in you in what you're drawing or painting, I thought is fascinating. And, you know, I'm glad I found it. And I don't want to stop just because the class ended.


Kyle Vasquez  12:50  
Yes, keep going. Yeah, I think one of the things I'm so excited about to have Seven Directions and be doing, you know, kids art as my primary career is, I, you know, as a teacher, in general have watched so many kids make the decision that they are not artists, and then stop. It's actually something I studied in college, there's like phases of artistic development, just like there's phases of literacy development, or all those things. And there's a phase in artistic development where a kid is going to show representational art to an adult, and look for the adults' feedback or approval. And, you know, there's studies that show that if a certain number of adults say like, oh, that's supposed to be a dog that doesn't look like a dog, or, you know, laugh or whatever. That kid makes the decision, oh, I'm not an artist. I'm bad at art. And they stop. And I think we all know, adults, right? Who have just been like, Oh, I'm just not an artist.


Interviewer  13:48  
It's family members. It made me yes, I'm saying that.


Kyle Vasquez  13:52  
The thing I keep, you know, I always try to tell people, adults or kids is like, everyone is an artist and visual art in particular, like, there's no one way to make art. And there's all kinds of different ways to express it. Exactly. You don't have to be able to do realistic representational art to be valid as an artist. And art doesn't have to be about the product to be valuable, right? Like, it can be. Like, I always think of like the Tibetan monks who make the beautiful mandala out of sand. And then as soon as they finish, they wipe the whole thing away. It's like, it's not about, oh, look, I made this beautiful thing. And now we're gonna hang it on a wall. It's more about the journey, not the destination. Exactly. And that's what creative things do for us. So I'm, you know, it's very exciting to be in a role where I get to help kids not decide that they're bad at art, quote, unquote, and you know, just to create an environment where kids are constantly learning that art is valuable to them, and that they are artists, regardless of what kind of art they make. And part of the reason that I ended up but Seven Directions is because my son was taking classes there and years of me as an artist and a teacher, not being able to teach my son art because I think he had seen me doing. I do lots of portraits, and he was like five and was like, mine doesn't look like that. He's very smart. He's a good observer, and then just decided he can't do art, even though I tried to tell him he could. Sometimes your mom can't be the person to do that, though. And when he went to Seven Directions with the former owner of moss, who is an amazing person, someone finally was able to tell him what I'd been trying to tell him that like you are an artist, and you can make art and you can feel empowered to be an artist. And I was just, this is the best place ever. It's the biggest gift if you can give that to a kid and I wasn't able to give it to my own kids. So sometimes when it's your kid, you just can't.


Interviewer  15:50  
But I'm glad that he found that. Very cool. And that must feel good for you too. Do you want to talk? Well, you're also a muralist, you want to tell us a little bit about that, and like for the plays that you're involved in, do you do any kind of set design stuff?


Kyle Vasquez  16:04  
You know, I do some. There's so many moving pieces when you're directing, like, a youth musical with 35 kids and sets and props and costumes, and you have a limited time to put it on. Our programs are very volunteer, parents do a lot of the sets and stuff. But yes, I have visions, and then they tend to execute them. But yeah, I've been doing art professionally for a long time. I mean, I've been doing art since I was a small child, right. But I've started doing murals. Man, maybe eight years ago, time is weird. I don't I can't keep track of it. But I did a mural at a recording studio up in Felton of jazz musicians. I like my first big mural jazz musicians and black and white, some of the, you know, the greats like Billie Holiday and and then we had a nebula like a rainbow Nebula in the background. And it was just like, you know, someone I knew who gave me this chance to try this thing and really fun, it was. It's an epiphany to make art huge. It's so different, right? Like you make a little mockup. And then you put it on a giant wall. And it's like, oh, it's a totally different thing once it's 30 times the size. So I've done a bunch of murals way up and humble. And did a bunch of murals up there for people that saw me on Facebook and invited me out and then probably the mural of mine that people in Santa Cruz know the most is if you've ever seen a van driving around town covered in tide pool paintings. That one is mine. I made that one and that is one of my co-workers from NBOG. So cool. Yeah. So if you see your type, we'll have a rolling around Sanford because I painted that one.


Interviewer  17:52  
I was just telling my girlfriend that it's great that I'm seeing a lot like some of the big walls like downtown. They're starting to like show up. You know, a lot of murals are starting to show up on these walls. And it's great. And some of them are like, are very powerful and have a lot of meaning behind them. Very cool.


Kyle Vasquez  18:08  
Yeah, made fresh crew has been doing beautiful things to bring public art just cruise which I really think is...


Interviewer  18:14  
Down by the Metro. There's an interesting one, with like a big mermaid. And she's like, kind of translucent. And it's about empowerment and stuff if you read about it and it's very cool.


Kyle Vasquez  18:21  
Yeah, they do really great work. I am happy about that.


# SEVEN DIRECTIONS


Interviewer  18:25  
Awesome. Thank you for sharing that. For those who are just tuning in. You're listening to the what to be show on KSQD Santa Cruz, 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart. And I'm speaking to Kyle Vasquez, who is the owner, director of Seven Directions Institute. Kyle, do you want to tell us a little bit more about Seven Directions? Like how long have they been there? And how do you get connected with would you say moss?


Kyle Vasquez  18:49  
Well, Seven Directions. It's in this old sash mill buildings, which is just near where we are now. Very cool. They've been there for about 20 years in that exact same space. It's gone through four owners now, the fourth over that period of time, and it's very hard to encapsulate what it is in words. Because, yes, it is a children's art studio, but it's also a learning center where we do lots of homeschool classes. It is an Institute of Art and Science. So there's a little bit of both. But it's like it's also like a community center. There's a quote on the website that says it's more than just an art studio. It's a magical cave of creativity which was from a 13 year old student and I'm like that's the closest I've been able to find. It's also I feel like a little mini like the Academy of Sciences if you go there ever in San Francisco, like my favorite place, so cool. So Seven Directions is this big open warehouse full of lots of light and you know, we have lots of art supplies and canvases and easels. We also have over 30 live animals that live there, predominantly reptiles and birds but also...


Interviewer  20:07  
No albino alligators.


Kyle Vasquez  20:09  
No albino alligators, but we do have an Argentinian black and white tegu whose name is Chung. He's about two feet long.


Interviewer  20:21  
Some kind of reptiles.


Kyle Vasquez  20:23  
Big ol lizard kind of looks like a mini Komodo dragon but all speckled and he's got big, puffy cheeks. Some people think he looks scary, but he's just the sweetest guy ever. He loves to be pet. He loves kids. Yeah, we've got parrots, we've got chameleons, we've got a bearded dragon. We've got lots of ball pythons and a seven foot Boa Constrictor, toads and geckos and all these different creatures, which are like what does that have to do with art, but there's something wonderfully inspiring about like, you know, like we said about NBOG, about being in nature that you can't always get when you're just in, you know, an art studio warehouse. So there's something about having all these creatures around. That's really magical and inspiring. And then, you know, just observing them is very, you learn so much about science and about art and creativity, but also just like, caring and loving, yes. And interacting with other beings, like just sitting there and realizing like, wow, how deeply I can communicate with this lizard.


Interviewer  21:33  
And it's so different. But yeah, yes, no, it's so powerful. The connection.


Kyle Vasquez  21:36  
Yeah, and there's something wonderful for kids who maybe have a harder time with social interaction, or trying to figure out how to connect to other kids to start with these animals. And then next thing, you know, the animals are kind of like the bonds that brings them all together. And you know, you see the kids who are scared of the snakes. And then eventually, they're all holding the seven foot snake together, and they're laughing and joking, and you know, becoming friends, is that nervous? All of our animals have, are very well trained to be around kids, and we know their personalities really well. A lot of them are rescues, but have been, you know, with kids since they were very small. So yeah, our seven foot boa constrictor is one of the friendliest creatures in the place. He just loves. Yeah, all the big ones that look scary, are the nicest ones.


Interviewer  22:26  
During the fires a couple of years ago, you know, I was down at the fairgrounds. And it was interesting, all the different animals that ended up there, not just like the livestock, but like the reptiles, you know, there were a lot of big turtles. And this one guy just had just about everything in there. Very beautiful, though.


Kyle Vasquez  22:41  
Yeah. So it's easy to forget, you know, dogs and cats and guinea pigs that all these other things exist too.


Interviewer  22:48  
So, you know, you just sort of took over ownership of Seven Directions.


Kyle Vasquez  22:53  
Yeah, so I, the, the previous owner, moss, who is a wonderful, remarkable human who, you know, kind of just tweaked the program a little bit to exist more in their image. And they added like anime classes and Pokeman classes, and all these interesting different styles of art. decided to move to Portland and focus on being a professional artist and not a teacher. And I think just over the time of my son being there, and US chatting, and me kind of commenting on how much I appreciated them in maybe the way that only other teachers will notice and do. They kind of I guess, just, it was very unexpected to me, but you know, they offered me this wonderful space. And at first I said, I don't think that I'm the right person. And then the more we talked, the more it was like, this is absolutely the right place for me. And it's everything I've ever done rolled into one place. So yeah, the last month has been me training and getting to know all the animals and their personalities and how to take care of them and how to work with them and kids, getting to know the space developing program that hopefully keeps a lot of the best of the classes that already existed going and then brings in some new things that are particular to me and what I'm passionate about, like yoga and mindfulness for kids of all ages, which is something I'm really passionate about, and kind of figuring out how to keep all the things that we love going about this space. And you know, also make it authentic to who I am as the director now.


Interviewer  24:34  
So yeah, and it seems like you were saying, like your background seems to be right on, right in sync with all this, you know, with the teaching and all the other stuff that you've done and do.


Kyle Vasquez  24:46  
Yeah, I just, it feels like, Oh, my whole life has been leading up to this moment. Like I make art and I work with kids and I love science and I love nature and I love animals and bring it all together and this is what this one space is.


Interviewer  24:59  
Pretty special feeling when you know that you're exactly where you're supposed to be, that everything's gonna be okay.


Kyle Vasquez  25:06  
Yeah. It's one of those things, it's hard to get your brain to really believe, but it feels so like the pieces fall into place. It's like, okay, it must just be the right thing.


Interviewer  25:16  
Do you have some good help there? Huh?


Kyle Vasquez  25:20  
I do. I have one other primary teacher, I'm going to probably be teaching the majority of the classes at least to start. But I have another teacher who's doing just a little less than half. A lot of the classes that we're continuing are the Pokeyman classes where they do literacy, and they do art and they make them whole like a terrarium of Pokemon worlds and then anime art for all different levels. I love all these things, not my wheelhouse as an artist. So we have a teacher who has worked there over the summer for many years with the former owner who is going to stay on and be one of my main teachers. And then mainly it's just me and then Haley who's going to be my main teacher. But I also have a wonderful teacher who works with me and NBOG coming in to support us, we have a LGBTQIA+ teen hangout that meets every Friday, which is something last establish that we're going to keep going because it's really important. Just, I think often queer teenagers have a hard time finding community. I know as a queer teenager, those kinds of spaces were really important for me when I was young, and having a space that isn't like, we're going to meet and talk about issues, which is also important.


Interviewer  26:42  
Forced or something.


Kyle Vasquez  26:43  
I mean, I think that's important too. But also, it's like you just need space to like, be a kid and make friends. And it's hard to do that, where we're talking about issues. So I have Margaret Hawkins, who's a wonderful person coming to lead that and they play games, and they make art and they hang out and talk and watch movies and do wonderful things. And what age groups. I have classes right now for ages three all the way up through adults, awesome. The majority of our classes are probably geared towards like five to 10. And then we have a handful of teen specific classes. But I do have one that's like pre K themed sensory art and science, a little bit of everything. Very playful. class for three to five year olds. And then I have two classes that are going to be for adults, which mainly just happened because a lot of adults that I know were like, I want to take that class that you made for kids and I'm like, Okay, let's do it.


Interviewer  27:41  
So pretty awesome. This is something that kids can maybe go to like a regular school and come after hours, or this is an alternative to traditional education.


Kyle Vasquez  27:52  
Um, both, we definitely have homeschool classes during the traditional school day hours, which tend to be maybe a little more academic geared so that homeschool parents can drop your kid off, run some errands, have some adult time with your kids. And then, you know, your kids' science learning for the week is done. And we will hand them back to you with like your learning samples you can turn in and stuff. And then we have after school programs too.
