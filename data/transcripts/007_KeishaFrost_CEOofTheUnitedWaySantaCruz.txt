# DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Interviewer 1 (Julian): If you don't mind, describing your current job. [00:01:00] And what kind of duties you have. 
Keisha Frost: All right. Well, I have the pleasure of being the Chief Executive Officer for United Way of Santa Cruz County.
We are an organization committed to children and youth well being throughout the county. As you may or may not know, we have about 94, 000 children who are ages 0 to 24 here in Santa Cruz County. We do. We do. And, and our work is committed to make sure that we can. Put young people on the right trajectory in life.
We want to make sure that our young people can graduate from high school with the confidence and belief in themselves, that they can go on to college if that's their goal, or that they can go on and start their career if that's their goal. We also know that we want to take care of them and their family.
And so we provide A variety of economic resources, things like the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance [00:02:00] Program, helping to prepare taxes for families and households here in Santa Cruz County. The other thing that we want to pay attention to is the health and wellness. of our young people. A healthy mind puts them in a, in a different, in a different state when it comes to being in the classroom.
So we want to make sure that, that they're in class, with things that they need. And last but not least, we also want to make sure that our young people are connected to our community. That means a lot to our young people that they know that there are adults, caring adults, neighbors and friends who are rooting for them, who believe in them.
So that's what United Way gets to do. We invest in collective impact work. We invest in, local programs and want to support them financially, help them implement the programs that are needed for addressing needs and, and tackling barriers for our young people. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): That's great. And so you supervise, you supervise all of that.
Keisha Frost: [00:03:00] I get to supervise all of that. 
# EARLY CAREER JOURNEY AND ENTRY INTO UNITED WAYS
Interviewer 1 (Julian): And how did that start? How did you start with United Way? 
Keisha Frost: Wow. Actually, I started with this United Way in Santa Cruz County back in 2012. I moved here from Charleston, South Carolina, where I was with United Way there. Came here to help with the philanthropic effort. Efforts here in Santa Cruz County.
We're in as you already know, a beautiful community. We have the majestic mountains and the picturesque ocean. I mean, this is just a place that you want to be and live. We also know that there's a tale of two cities that for all of the  peace and quiet and tranquility that we get to enjoy and the quality of life that is here.
We know that that's not a quality of life shared by everyone. And that's where United Way steps in, is that we want to make sure that everyone in our [00:04:00] community.  from students to the babies that are born to those who have chose to retire here and call Santa Cruz County home. We want the quality of life to be shared by everyone here.
So yes, I came in to help raise funds and now I get to lead it and I'm really happy about that. The other thing that's remarkable is that United Way of Santa Cruz County has been here since 1941. And, With me coming on board as CEO, I'm the first person of color to serve in this role. And I'm, yes, and I'm the fifth African American CEO for United Way in the state of California.
So it means a lot to me that, our children, it is empowering. It is empowering and, of course my daughter tells everyone I'm the, CEO of the United States. But it means a lot to have, our young people know that they can look at leadership in [00:05:00] this community and see themselves when they look at, the leaders here.
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Yeah, I think seeing a leader who is of color, I think, students of color, is so empowering and so motivational. 

# REFLECTING ON EARLY CAREER GOALS AND LEADERSHIP ASPIRATIONS
Interviewer 2 (Melina): I have a question. So, as CEO, what kind of things do you do, like, on a day to day and a weekly basis? I know you probably do a lot. 
Keisha Frost: I do a lot now.
Interviewer 1 (Julian): If you can just describe, like, what your day to day is.
Keisha Frost: I will start with a 7:30 board meeting. With health leaders here, hospitals, we sit and we talk about the challenges and barriers and trying to create strategies on how we can address barriers. I can go from a meeting like that to sitting at lunch, sitting at lunch with a person who's been in Santa Cruz County for 40 years.
And they want to know the latest on what United Way is up to. I can go from there to being [00:06:00] invited to, serving as a moderator, for a different event. I serve on several boards, including Your Future is Our Business. I can go to events and chamber mixers. It's really a fascinating, role. I also manage the United Way in San Benito county.
So, there's a, another community there that I have to switch hats and know that when I'm in San Benito. So you're, you're 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): two CEOs in San Benito County? Yes. Yes. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): That must be difficult though, because I think, I feel like the, just priorities are very different.
Keisha Frost: From county to county.
Interviewer 1 (Julian): to county. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Is it difficult to juggle all at once?
Keisha Frost: It is, but what I've, what I do is I operate out of my belief and what I stand for is dignity, compassion and integrity. So no matter the community, those three things are what people deserve and that's what they want and that's what I'm here to do as a leader is to make [00:07:00] sure that if, if we have a neighbor who's unsheltered, that I am helping them in a way that's dignified to them.
That a way that shows, compassion and being open and honest and transparent with our community. 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): Very important. And then I have another question. What kind of skills or personalities best suited for someone who wants to be a CEO? Oh! Ha ha ha! And did you always know that you wanted to be a CEO? You know!
Or that one day you would be? 
Keisha Frost: Well, qualities include, just having that determination and that tenacity to, To stay, to stay focused on your goals. With that, you have to kind of have what I call bozo ability. Remember that flexible clown, a little inflatable clown? You could push it. It would bend down, but then it pops right back up.
And that's what CEOs have to, to know and embody and embrace.  we're going to get knocked down. [00:08:00] Everything's not going to go our way. We're going to go and head in a direction and it may not be right. And we have to be able to have that level of resiliency to dust ourselves up, pick ourselves up and keep going.
# FURTHER ASPIRATIONS AND EARLY INSPIRATIONS
Keep going forward. you ask if I always thought I was going to be a CEO. Actually, it was, the year was 1984. And I saw President Reagan give the State of the Union address. No, on TV. And I remember sitting with my father and I said, I can do that. I think I want to be president. I'm a seven. You're a seven?
I can do that. I can be president. It's, it's so, not necessarily thinking a CEO, but, 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): a leader 
Keisha Frost: of some sort.  and maybe that's my middle child syndrome too. Like having an older sibling, I'm like, one day I'm going to tell somebody what to do. I had my little brother and I'm like, yes, [00:09:00] but no, I just, I knew that I wanted to be in a, in a leadership role.
And when I went to college at the university of Washington, I wanted to be an athletic director.  I ran track and ran track for the university of Washington and, I was set to on that pathway. Yes. 1996 Olympics. Yes. Yes. Totally retired now. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Short distance? No 
Keisha Frost: hurdles. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Yes. 
Keisha Frost: When I tell you about Bull's ability, the one thing that we did as a hurdler, one thing I really appreciate my coach did, he made us purposely fall over the hurdle.
Because he said, what is your biggest fear? Your biggest fear is falling. So guess what? Get it over with. Fall. Now you notice you're okay. You still lift. You're still here with broken elbow. It healed. And you [00:10:00] learn from it. So, you know, just those things, those, skills and, and the different experiences I had in track makes for the kind of leader that I am today to be resilient, to be persistent, to, be fearless and maybe not so much.
It's not that I'm not afraid. But I am going to have the courage to stand up, where we are today as a United Way is that we are totally shifting our focus to become, kind of have a laser beam focus on children and youth well being, where in the past we Funded a lot of great and amazing programs.
# LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY AND MENTORS
But as we're moving forward, we're committed to investing in collective impact and how do we really support children and youth.  if we help them, they're going to build an incredible, thriving Santa Cruz County for our future. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): And did you ever have, someone in your career, in your professional career, [00:11:00] besides your athletic one, that was kind of like your coach?
Speaker 5: Yes! Yes! 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Just doesn't matter what people say, just push through. Yes. But not in an athletic sense. No, 
Keisha Frost: no. You know, I, I have, just along the way, I mean, most recent is, the previous CEO of United Way of Santa Cruz County, Mary Lou Goeke.  when I moved here in 2012 and met her, I knew, like, wow, this is where I want to be.
And I was able to really sit down and share with her. I want your job when you retire. 
Speaker 4: And she 
Keisha Frost: said, really? Okay. And she spent two to three years mentoring me, preparing me, putting me in positions where I could be that decision maker for our organization. And having that belief in me and just reminding me that.
You know, you can do this, that, it's okay. And so I, I appreciate Mary Lou Gakey, of course, Martina O'Sullivan here in [00:12:00] our community as well.  she retired from Dominican hospital. She was community engagement. When I first met, came here, Martina took me to Cafe Cruz and she wrote out my strategic plan on the butcher paper that's on the table.
And but, and I still have that, I still have that to this day because she mapped out Santa Cruz County. You know, here are people who are in our community that you want to get to know, here are folks that you know, you can call them up, you can count on them for X, Y, and Z. So those two women have truly been mentors, to me here in Santa Cruz County.
Interviewer 2 (Melina): Besides those two women, do you get any professional training or education for being a CEO? 
Keisha Frost: Absolutely. So United Way is a worldwide brand. Just a small fun plug, we're the 11th most recognizable brand. We come under That's a fact. We come under Verizon. We're working on it.  [00:13:00] but yeah, United Way worldwide offers a lot of professional development.
So I was actually selected to participate in their advanced leadership program. They identified me. Ip and coming leaders. And so just to build that pipeline for United Way. I was one of 25 at the time from around the world who got to go and spend six months, worth of training. 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): Wow. 25. 
Keisha Frost: Yes. 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): 25 in the world.
Yes. 
Keisha Frost: Yes. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): It was like a mix of people from. 
Keisha Frost: All over. Well, we have Mexico. We had Vancouver, Canada. But United Way is on every continent, actually. Except Antarctica. 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): Yes! Helping the penguins out there. Right, right! 
Keisha Frost: They need a quality of life, too. 
# CURRENT WORK AND INITIATIVES AT UNITED WAYS
Interviewer 2 (Melina): So, can you explain a favorite memory you have from this job?
Keisha Frost: You know, it's [00:14:00] what we're doing now. So imagine this. For nearly 30, 40 years, Your United Way and this community, like I said, have invested in a variety of programs that have done amazing things.
Well now, today, there's a shift in philanthropy. All this technology that we have in this radio station right now, I mean those things make it easier for a donor to give to an, to an organization. So United Way's role has changed from being an intermediary to finding out what else can we do in our community.
So right now I'm creating this fun experience where I'm redesigning the program model. And the funding model. I know. That nerds me out. Sounds like a lot of 
Speaker 4: work. It's a lot 
Keisha Frost: of work! Because We're saying that, our focus is going to be on children and youth, we're going to look at wraparound and support services, and now we're [00:15:00] going to invest in collective impact, meaning we're going to start investing in clusters of programs, working together to achieve the same outcomes.
 we believe that you're going to have a greater impact when we have multiple non profits all coming together to say, We want to make sure that all of our young people are graduating on time, college and career ready. We want to make sure that our young people are, they have access to mental well being resources.
We want to make sure that families have the resources that they need to thrive. We work better together than we do in these silos of excellence. So, we're, we're building that model right now, and it's exciting because there are some blueprints out here across the country, but we get to design the blueprint for Santa Cruz County.
# ADVICE FOR YOUNG ASPIRING LEADERS
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Can you give advice for students, high school or college students who [00:16:00] fear, who have a fear that they're not good enough, because I'm sure you see that quite often, that you see these kids coming from. I don't know, a long community and they feel like they're not good enough. So what kind of advice could you give to a listener that's probably listening to overcome their fears?
Keisha Frost: Yeah. I would say, and I, and I heard this, this Sunday during the Oscars, Heather Belcher, when she became the first African American to win for product design for Black Panther. I get, yes. Did my very best and that was good enough. You, you really have to step into that. I'm, I'm someone who was born and raised in South Central Los Angeles.
I mean, the riots of 1992 started three blocks away from my high school. So, here I am being told by maybe society that, Oh, South Central, [00:17:00] Compton, Huh? A CEO? Never. But I had enough people in my community that pushed me, that said yes, your best is good enough, and we're going to make sure that you succeed, so that you can turn around and pay it forward to the next student.
So I'm here to tell every college student, I'm here to tell every student, your best is good enough. Is good enough and don't, don't be afraid. Try something. What's the worst thing that'll happen? Oh, it doesn't work out. Okay, do something else. That's how you learn. That's how you learn. 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): Are there any challenges or hurdles you face within this occupation?
Yes. Oh, yes, there are. There 
Keisha Frost: are hurdles. No pun intended. There are hurdles you face. I mean, as a CEO. There is this, belief that you want to make the very [00:18:00] best decision. You know, we raise a little over a million dollars. And you're trusting our organization to turn around and reinvest that money back into our community.
So you want, you know, To make sure that you're doing your due diligence, that you're selecting, programs that are really going to yield that return on impact. At the same time, you, you have to be realistic about your capacity, and as a CEO, you sometimes don't want to say no. Saying no is a hard thing to do.
But you know that you have to. So, when I say no, I'm not just no and I walk away and I have nothing to do with it. I can be a champion for the work that's being done. Doesn't mean that I have to make sure my feet are planted there. I don't have to always be that. So I look at, as my role as CEO. is to trust that there's a constellation being [00:19:00] built around me.
Trust that there are amazing non profits out there, and amazing leaders who are doing work, and there's a group of fascinating, dynamic folks working on homelessness. There are a group of fascinating people working on substance use disorder. And there are folks working on housing. There's people working on education and lifelong learning.
Build that constellation where I don't have to feel that I have to be in every arena. I can focus on what United Ways will, what we do well, which is youth and children well being. And I can trust that other leaders are doing their part in those other sectors. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): And so what was the, I think, before you got this position, you would see the CEO.
Would you? picture the position differently than what, what it actually entitles or that change? 
Keisha Frost: You know, I think in [00:20:00] other experiences, yes, it would be different. I used to work for Girl Scouts throughout the country as well. And it, What I thought the position would be, it was different. It was really different.
It's more than cookies, okay, people? More than cookies, but buy those cookies. But with, with the Not sponsored. Not sponsored. But, with United Way here, my mentor did a really good job to make me, make sure that I was shoulder to shoulder with her, that I could see the behind the scenes, because the the challenges of, well, if you say no here, here are the effects.
So think about that, you know, so I, it is what I thought it would be. It is what I thought it would be. This community has been amazing and embracing me as a new leader. I think that it meant a lot to a lot of the leadership [00:21:00] here in this county that I was here five or six years. So this community had a chance to get to know me.
# QUALITIES OF GOOD LEADERS
Interviewer 1 (Julian): And what are, what would you say are some qualities of a good leader? 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): Or a great leader versus a good leader. 
Keisha Frost: Ahhhh. A great leader will be in this, this stage of continuous improvement. Don't ever think you know it all. There's always an opportunity to learn something more. A great leader. sets aside ego. I mean, I have an amazing staff.
We are 10 tiny and mighty, leaders here, and I am not a person with an ego that can't, that, that feels that I have to be the only one leading. I probably get on their nerves, but I check in with them first. What do you think? Okay. We want to invest a million dollars [00:22:00] in children and youth. What do you think?
Where should we go? What should our focus be? So just making sure that you include others at the table. Another great leader has to understand that there will be hard decisions to be made and you're going to have to make them. And you have to understand and be okay that this isn't a job of popularity and you're not going to always be liked by everyone.
But when you're doing what you know is right, you can continue to hold your head up. and just know that, okay, today you don't like me, tomorrow will come. Those are marks of great leadership. 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): I agree. What are some steps that, say someone is interested in the ACO, what kind of steps would they take to get there?
Keisha Frost: Sure. Well, there is your, your formal education. You know, my degree is actually speech communications, public relations, dabbled in radio. So there's the formal [00:23:00] education and I really applaud universities for branching out. I'm starting to see a lot of nonprofit leadership, courses out there and degrees in that world.
So, but also. Take time to step up and sign up and volunteer. If there are leadership roles, if there are committees you can join. While I was in college, I did join a sorority. And while I was doing that, when I wasn't running track, I'm raising my hand to volunteer. 
So don't be afraid to get out there and put yourself in those positions of leadership to join committees.
Sit in on board meetings that you can sit on. I think the, The internship program and process that's with Your Future is Our Business is a great model for other nonprofits to look at because I feel that the interns are truly getting that hands on experience in leadership and the behind the scenes look of what it would take to run an organization.
So yeah, just sign up for committees, [00:24:00] finance committee, one of them. You need to learn how to write the budget. You need to know how to read. The non profit budget, it's a lot different from a for profit company. but yeah, volunteer, take on leadership roles, do things from program to finance to marketing and fundraising.
A little bit of everything. 
Keisha Frost: A little bit of everything. 
# EGO AND HUMILITY IN LEADERSHIP
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Yes. And like you said, having that kind of, you're not the one that knows the most out of everybody. No. Yes, get rid of 
Keisha Frost: the ego. Yes, 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): right, right. And so what were some of your first jobs and how did those jobs, 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): how did I get it? 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Have they ever helped you?
Keisha Frost: Oh, yes. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Today? 
# FIRST JOB EXPERIENCE AND HUMILITY
Keisha Frost: Oh my gosh. So, I graduated from college, and right out of college I was getting married, right? So I go into this store, won't mention the store's name, but I go into this bridal store to look for a wedding gown. I did not have a [00:25:00] job. So my mother said, well, unemployed people get to look at the 99 gowns, but of course every gown I wanted.
99. And so she said, that's for folks with jobs. Well, the consultant and I just hit it off. The wedding consultant and I hit it off and she said, well, you should apply. We need wedding consultants. I'm like, Sure, I've never had a job before. Track and field was my job since 5th grade, okay? 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): I 
Keisha Frost: had a job, yeah.
So I was like, sure, I'll fill out the application. Because I had a degree, they made me the store manager of the bridal store. And it was your first job, 
Speaker 4: too? 
Keisha Frost: Out of college. 
Speaker 4: The 
Keisha Frost: degree was still in the mail. So here I am with a punch, one of those things you punch a clock and I didn't know how to work the machine.
Did 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): you even have a 
Keisha Frost: resume to give them? No! My resume was 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): track. 
Keisha Frost: I ran [00:26:00] track. And I have a degree. You're just that 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): charismatic. Yes! 
Keisha Frost: What did you do before? Ran the store. And that's when I learned, put your ego aside and look for the others to help you. Because I'm like, I You're a store manager. That degree meant a lot back in the early 2000s.
Interviewer 2 (Melina): Did you end up getting your dress through that talk? 
Keisha Frost: I did. I got the dress I wanted. So from there, like I said, I did work for Girl Scouts and I, I was with a program. Fundraising, communications with Girl Scouts. I was actually on track to become a CEO of a Girl Scout Council. And then I made the switch when I moved to Rhode Island.
I was actually recruited by, the mayor at the time. He's now Congressman Cicilline, but he was Mayor David Cicilline at the time. And 12 of us created the nation's [00:27:00] first city wide after school system for middle school students, and it was the Providence After School Alliance. Still exists today. And from there I tapped into, United Way.
# DISCOVERY OF UNITED WAY'S IMPACT
And, and when I went to United Way, that's where I learned, wow, okay, this is like an umbrella organization. It's not that we run our own programs, but we built the capacity for other nonprofits to do their incredible work. We're supporting them financially. We're supporting them with training and workshop and advocacy.
So I said, this is where I want to be. Yeah. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Yeah, I think we all have the, I think every human wants to help others. But what made you want to help children and youth in specific? 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): Julia. 
Interviewer 2 (Melina): And why did you switch from Girl Scouts 
Keisha Frost: to non profit? Yeah. Well, you know, And it's interesting that it was Girl Scouts and the United [00:28:00] Way.
So when I was in fifth grade, I'm at school. Like I said, grew up in South Central LA. My parents both worked. Neither one of them got off from work at 2. 30 to come pick me up. And my parents didn't want me to walk home by myself and be at home alone. So it was United Way that came into my elementary school and brought in Girl Scouts.
They brought in Boys and Girls Club. They brought in, Tutoring, Parks and Rec. So that's where I was exposed to track and field and Girl Scouts. I actually earned my gold award in Girl Scouts.  but it was, it was the United Way bringing in this potpourri of services to wrap around, bring those services into our school and it kept us busy.
It kept us connected and in a safe environment with caring adults. It was the way I was exposed to these, all of these things. So it comes around full circle that I got [00:29:00] to be employed by Girl Scouts throughout this country, be employed with a United Way. 
Interviewer 1 (Julian): And now you're a CEO. 
Keisha Frost: And now I'm a CEO. So now I get to do it. So yeah. 
# FINAL ADVICE TO LISTENERS
Interviewer 1 (Julian): So the last question we have for you is, what is a thought, question, or simple piece of advice you would like to leave our listeners with? 
Keisha Frost: My advice to you is to really tap into what you burn for. I mean, what what do you stand for? And like I said, for me, I stand for dignity, compassion, and integrity.
I care about being of service to all mankind. I care about other human beings. So whether it's United Way, Girl Scouts, whether I'm in America or China, those three things that I burn for are going to stay with me. So no matter what you do, stay true to who you are. [00:30:00] And lead with that. That's going to direct you, you know.
And when you really enjoy what you're doing, you'll never work a day in your life. I'm not counting down to 2042 when I'm eligible to retire. I'm truly enjoying it.
