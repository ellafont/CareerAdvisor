And today, I had the pleasure to speak to Elizabeth Shaw, who is a teacher with the Santa Cruz Office of Education, who works in alternative education, who also teaches it essentials at Cabrillo College, which is a magnet program. Hi, Elizabeth.


Elizabeth Shaw  0:52  
Yes, I am. Hi, Patrick. Thank you for having me on today. 


Interviewer  0:57  
Oh, thank you very much. Yeah. Well, sorry about the little bit of technical problems. But we're very, I'm very glad that you're on now.


Elizabeth Shaw  1:03  
Thank you. Me too.


#CAREER JOURNEY
Interviewer  1:06  
Awesome. Elizabeth, do you mind briefly describing your career journey for us?


Elizabeth Shaw  1:11  
Sure. You know, I can tell you that Patrick have had an extremely non traditional career journey. You know, I didn't really do very well in school, I struggled in high school, I struggled in college. And after not being able to finish college, I ended up you know, economic situations, I ended up having to work full time. You know, a lot of times I had work two jobs. I had my share of fun jobs, I was in retail, I was a Starbucks barista. I worked in sales, at one point, I was even a restaurant reviewer and wrote restaurant critics restaurant reviews for a little magazine in Santa San Diego. But I then ended up taking a bunch of temp jobs through different agencies. And that's when I sort of accidentally fell into a career in information technology. I worked with a company that installed telecommunication systems, and somebody was absent one day, and they sent me out on the job site to help train people to use their phones. And it turned out to be something I really enjoyed, you know, training people how to use technology. And that turned into helping to design and implement network topography and network solutions to you know, share from one office to another.


 That kind of led me into most of my understanding about hardware and architecture and communications. And then I just continued in, in that it field and sort of accidentally, again, fell into a job is as a business analyst. And I fell into that job because we had a company that had a new software program that was rolling out and it didn't go very well. And so I was their Beta tester. And I spent so much time in the IT Helpdesk, having them fix problems that they finally just said, why don't you just work for us, and we'll, we'll have you tested and help fix it. So that ended up leading to, again, more, more learning. And I will say that I have had an amazing journey of on the job training. And I've also had the benefit of amazing mentors along the way. I've had people who, who really believed in me and helped push me forward to learn and grow and expand. And then I kept continuing to work hard, and I decided to go back and finish my undergraduate degree. So I got my bachelor's degree, and again, kept, I keep saying I fell into jobs, I didn't fall in really, the opportunity was there. I had people who supported me and encouraged me and I took a risk. 


So in each of these cases, I just, I knew I didn't know what I was going to do. And I knew I didn't know maybe the technology or the industry. But I thought well, I can learn it. And I did. And then that kind of that was about 15 years in a career in it. And I was a actually an information technology manager with United Parcel Service, which was a great job. I learned an incredible amount of technology, and also how to work with people. Then I had somewhat of a personal crisis. I lost my father, he passed and I went actually decided I'm going to move to San Jose, California to be with my mom. And, you know, during that whole time as I was reevaluating, sort of my my place in life in the world I realized that I was missing a pretty big connection to my community. So this is where I kind of, it's again, another epiphany of connection is I decided I wanted to work directly in, you know, directly with people who I felt I could support. 


And I wanted to give back to some of my mentors who had supported me and helped me grow. So I thought, I'm going to be a teacher. And I became a K through 12, substitute teacher in Santa Cruz in Watsonville. And then happened upon this amazing program through the Santa Cruz County Office of Education. And they have this program called Alternative Education, which is for high school students throughout Santa Cruz. And it's really for students who don't fit into the traditional mainstream High School, for whatever reason, personal reasons, whatever, you know, social emotional anxiety, there may be circumstances in their lives that they just they don't fit the traditional, comprehensive school setting. And we provide education to them. And I've been with Santa Cruz County Office of Education as a teacher for 12 years. And definitely connect to my community and feel as if I'm giving back to a lot of the mentors that I've been, you know, all the advantages that I have received from people supporting me along the way. 


I also currently have the opportunity of teaching an ITE essentials class. And that's where I kind of bring together all my technical experience and what I what I learned about software and hardware networking, and put it back in the classroom. And so it's a magnet program and it's for all, all kids Santa Cruz County high school students. We currently represent over 12 high schools in Santa Cruz and it is a Cabrillo course. So students are enrolled in high school and they can earn Cabrillo College credit. And I teach I teach it on the Watsonville. Cabrillo campus, and I teach it in Midtown Santa Cruz. So it's, you know, again, my journey is non traditional. I started in one direction was very, very successful and happy and recreated everything sort of mid life. And now, it's been an equal amount of years in education, and I couldn't be happier. Well,


#JOB/COMMUNITY
Interviewer  7:38  
yeah, your journey sounds awesome. And, I'm glad that you found what you do. Now, it sounds like you found, a lot of meaning in your work, you know, in finding community and supporting the people that you were, that you thought you could best help. Right? 


Elizabeth Shaw  8:23  
Absolutely. Yeah. And we were talking earlier this evening, and I was sharing with you that, you know, just kind of going through uncomfortable things, and that we were talking about that sometimes when we, you know, a lot of growth happens by putting ourselves in uncomfortable situations. And absolutely, yeah, and just saying yes. And putting yourself out there. I think that we can surprise ourselves sometimes. And yeah, open. Yeah, open to opportunities as they come.


Interviewer  8:27  
Yeah, it can be tough sometimes. Right?


Elizabeth Shaw  8:30  
It can, particularly with students who are young and, and not, you know, not knowing that they have a voice and not knowing that they have their own agency. And that's one of the things that, you know, we that I really feel a passion for encouraging students to explore their options and move past any boundaries and work through obstacles that may be underway. Yeah,


Interviewer  8:53  
that's great. And so with the alternative education that you teach, so, do you want to talk about some of the, you know, the different you know, what that actually looks like?


Elizabeth Shaw  9:06  
Absolutely, yes. So, we have 18 different programs throughout Santa Cruz County, from all the way from Watsonville down to the San Lorenzo Valley. The programs are small campuses, some of them are large campuses. We have a charter school of Cypress charter school which is a fully A through G college prep. High School. In really, it's it's tailored individually for student needs. It could be a geographic name, it could be a personal need. There's a demographic there we have a school inside the camp Recovery Center, which is an adolescent Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center. So we provide school to students who happen to be in rehab. We have a school in the juvenile hall so that students can be served no matter where they are no matter what circumstances they may find themselves in. It's an academically rigorous, comprehensive program that really supports college and career readiness, and the amount of sheer services available in Santa Cruz County. Is it staggering when I think about other counties, even in California, and then other states, a lot of people who can't who don't make it through or are not able to fit in at a regular high school, their only option is a continuation high school. And that just isn't it isn't something that Santa Cruz has to deal with, we have a variety of services that really support students and give them what they need to succeed. And teachers. They're an amazing group of educators, all of our staff and everyone who works with our students, from our counselors to the support staff, just have the students in their mind the students and the families, and provide an educational opportunity that the really, it's heart rending heart heart warming. And when, you know, I always want people in my life, or people in the community come to one of our graduation ceremonies, and really see what it's like to have a student prepare a speech, and explaining how they've, how far they've come and how amazing their journeys have been. And literally, there are very few dry eyes in the places when our students really speak from their hearts about what they've learned how they've grown, and how this experience has really changed them in such a positive direction. Oh,


Interviewer  11:54  
that's really beautiful. And that also must feel very affirming to you, you know, doing what you do, to experience moments like that.


Elizabeth Shaw  12:02  
Absolutely. Especially since I was one of those students who got lost. I fell through the cracks when I was in high school. And I didn't have that, you know, that support behind me. And it took me it took me, you know, decades to finish college. And I tell my students, it's never too late to start over because I've started over twice now. And I also tell them, it's never too late to start. And even when they're in high school, they can they can get on the pathway. They can have and they can actually take college courses while they're still in high school. We have students who are dual enrolled at Cabrillo College. In fact, we have a high school campus to high school campuses on Cabrillo College, both in Aptos and Watsonville. So we're in a natural bridge to the community college system. Students can go to college while they're in high school, and they can get the support that they need. And because community colleges in California are free for all Santa Cruz graduates, they can have two years of college. It's an amazing education with an amazing amount of support and would have essentially an AAA degree with hopefully zero debt.


Interviewer  13:26  
Oh, that's so awesome. What a great opportunity for the students. And yeah, just what you guys are doing with making that transition from high school to community college, and then maybe on from there just like kind of a more seamless, seamless. Absolutely. And also I loved what you're doing. You know, you said that you kind of took things that you went through in your life, and you're using that in a positive way now to help others at this thing. That's beautiful. Thank


Elizabeth Shaw  13:52  
you. Gotcha. Yeah,


Interviewer  13:53  
absolutely. So you're pretty busy. Dude, do you want to tell us kind of what your like a typical day or week might look like for you? And maybe it's changed over the past couple years to?


Elizabeth Shaw  14:04  
Yeah, it has. You know, I started out as a teacher, and I've been I've been a classroom teacher for 12 years. And I've kind of worked in most of our programs in alternative education. So we have a really good broad understanding of, of, you know, the student population and sort of the, what our teachers go through. And what that sort of led me into is that one of my other labs is developing programs and curriculum and establishing community partnerships. And so this year I actually took on the role we call it in education speak. We love our acronyms. We call it a Tosa, which is the teacher on special assignment. And that just means that I do other things in addition to teaching and this year, I'm working with our staff on professional development, curriculum and instruction School Safety, communications, you know, pretty much anything that supports staff and students in how to really, you know, provide an academically rigorous and supportive emotional, social and emotional learning environment. And so that's incredibly exciting. And I do I do that I've 100% job for that. But I also have a really exciting teaching contract, and that's also through the Santa Cruz County Office of Education. And we have a US department or division. It's our career services. And it's where we have to provide technical and career education. So if somebody wants to take an EMT course, or if they want to have a vet tech or a medical technician, or even a bike construction class, and these are all career industries, and we have industry leaders who teach these courses, and this year I'm teaching a course called it essentials and that is a Cisco Certified course and it is also articulated through Cabrillo College so that students who pass with a B or higher they can actually earn Cabrillo College credits. And this is what we call a magnet program. So, as a magnet, it can attract students from any high school in Santa Cruz. So it doesn't have to just be Santa Cruz County Office of Education. 


It could be Santa Cruz city schools or Scotts Valley or any of the SLV we have right now in my two sections that I teach. We have 12 different high schools represented. So if you know all the way including Watsonville High School, PV High School, AP TAs, hi SoCal. Hi SLV coast redwood Delta, Scotts Valley, Scotts Valley High School, you know, all these students are coming together, they don't know each other, they have to be you know, they find the road transportation, they arrive at our class, one of them is in Watsonville on the Cabrillo Watsonville campus, and the other is in Midtown, Santa Cruz. And it's this amazing hands-on collaborative, really student-centered, technology-driven class. And it's a year-long, and it has just been such an amazing opportunity. This is the first year that we've offered it. And we have had an amazing program. Our students have done some phenomenal things. I mean, you know, we think technologically-wise, a lot of people know how to use their phones. And a lot of people know how to use their video game consoles. But I wouldn't say a lot of people understand the Internet behind it. And they may not understand the workings and the hardware of a computer. The students in my classes, they have actually taken apart a computer from the entire computer all the way down to the CPU and the motherboard, put it back together, got it in working condition, installed the software got everything working using a monitor using a VGA cord using an HDMI cord. I mean, they went from, you know, never having touched a computer for most of them. And there they are, and it's working, and then they love it.


Interviewer  18:33  
Wow. And then yeah, that could very well just spark something within them and you know, could turn into a whole career going down into it or something.


Elizabeth Shaw  18:40  
That's the idea. Yeah, it's called an it's called a pathway. And this is the amazing partnership that we have in Santa Cruz. Again, I can't speak more highly of Cabrillo College, and what it offers so it's an ICT pathway or information communication technology. And right now we have one pathway and then in the next two years we're building up to three pathways and they mirror what Cabrillo College has and they also are industry standard. So a student could start the pathway this year let's say your one is this class which is the foundation then next year they would take two classes at Cabrillo and then they would have the equivalent of an industry sort of certificate that would allow them to go into virtually you know any type of IT related field and or have them feel confident and competent to go into a four-year university and really just focus on their IT career and it's an amazing Head Start.


Interviewer  19:47  
It's a very cool, thank you for sharing that. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the what to be show on KS QD Santa Cruz. I'm Patrick Hart, and I'm speaking with Elizabeth Shaw, who's a teacher with the Santa Cruz Office of Education, who works in alternative education as a teacher on special assignments, and who also teaches at Cabrillo College, a class called it essentials. Elizabeth, I was wondering, do you mind sharing with us, you know, what kind of people you think might enjoy the type of work that you do?


Elizabeth Shaw  20:19  
Absolutely. So for the the alternative education route, so anyone who wants to go into education, you know, as,  everyone knows, education is a challenging field. And it is also an incredibly important field. So anyone who is really looking to make a difference, touch people's lives, and be able to use all the personality tricks that you have it as well as engage, really in a collaborative way, and make a difference in a young person's life. Education would be an amazing field, I couldn't speak more, more highly of the ability to connect to an individual and how important seeing the light come on, in a student's eyes. I can't say enough about how that is the spark and creates a drive for me to do my job every day. And alternative education is particularly in Santa Cruz County, we have the most amazing administrative support. Our superintendent, Dr. Farris abaa, has an incredible heart for students and families, and really puts a focus on social justice and equity, and supports all of his staff in in a way that I found unparalleled. And then my my colleagues, the teachers that I work with the staff that I work with, everyone puts the student first. And that I think is is, you know, not something often found in a larger organization, where everyone has a shared vision, and everyone has a shared mission and focus. And that's education. That's, you know, a good part of what I do. I also would love to advocate for communication technology. I think that if I'm, and I'm speaking to families and students right now, if your student has any interest in technology, and that includes video gaming, because that is an incredibly, incredibly good start toward technology, if there's any interest in that direction, or if you have an interest in being an entrepreneur or having your own business, or if you're someone who enjoys communication, this is a fantastic time to get into this field. The opportunities are growing immensely just in Santa Cruz, not to mention worldwide, cybersecurity is an incredibly important focus, networking skills. And all of these technology related fields have to have a foundation. And if you're looking to get into this field, take a look at what we have to offer for it essentials. We also have other opportunities in cybersecurity. We have a cybersecurity a cyber security club, we have summer cyber camps, and they're just ways to get connected with technology and support people's interest. And then maybe like you said, Patrick, maybe that will fan that spark and lead them into an a career that's not only lucrative, but theirs is also very rewarding.


Interviewer  23:46  
Yeah, that's awesome. Thank you for sharing that. That's all really good stuff. And, you know, do you work in a typical classroom setting, or like what kind of environments do you work in between the two different schools?


Elizabeth Shaw  23:59  
Yeah, so it my, it's great in my first at the Watsonville campus that Ken Cabrillo Watsonville, I work at Digital nest, which is an amazing community based organization. And that we have a small, small space in the digital nest office area and for anyone who has never gone to the digital nest at Cabrillo Watsonville take a look at their website. Think about anything you can get yourself involved in it's an amazing opportunity for young people. It's a small room we have everyone has one to one Chromebooks and we do a lot of moving and you know, of course we have a lot of online things because we are studying computers, but we also take computers apart. And the same thing in my Midtown Santa Cruz course that that class is a little bit larger and we have a little bit larger cohort. So you know, we don't sit still we do diagrams, we end up just, you know, taking over the entire whiteboard space and writing on the floor and writing on on butcher paper on the wall and trying to keep people moving. It sounds fun. Right? It is. It's really fun like I Yeah, students have told me they really enjoy the course and are really surprised by how much they've learned and how much they've enjoyed it.


Interviewer  25:26  
Oh, that's, that's really cool. Thank you. And, Elizabeth, what kind of advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in, you know, maybe becoming a teacher or in line with some of the other things that you do too.


Elizabeth Shaw  25:39  
I would love to give you some information on how to get involved in computer science and technology. I have some websites I can share. If you're interested in thinking about it pathway, you know, the ITE essentials course or you want to learn more about cybersecurity. We have a website, which is C S. C is in Charlie SS and Sam dot Santa Cruz c o e.org. And that's our Computer Science website that has everything that is offered for all of K through 12 in Santa Cruz, because Santa Cruz County Office of Education supports everything K through 12. Okay, and you'll even see there's a cyber clubs starting up on February 8, which is going to be an after school virtual cyber club, really fun. And then for cybersecurity, I would suggest base cyber.net. And we have these amazing summer cyber camps and they're coming up, registration will probably be opening around April. They'll be in person or virtual. Okay. And their three weeks of free cybersecurity training.
