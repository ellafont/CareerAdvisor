Hi, Ken. 


[00:00:47] Ken Doctor: 


Hello. 


[00:00:49] Interviewer: 


Hey there. Thank you very much for taking the time to help me out and do this interview. 


[00:00:53] Ken Doctor: 


Sure. Glad to be here. 


[00:00:54] Interviewer: 


Yeah, really appreciate it. And Ken, you've done a lot in your career. Do you mind briefly explaining your career journey for us? 


[00:01:00] Ken Doctor: 


Well, it started here in Santa Cruz at UCSC. I got here in the early years, not quite the pioneer class, but soon after.


When UCSC was brand new and I went to First Stevenson College, my first year at UCSC in 1967. And then in 68, I transferred to Merrill College. Graduated into a interesting world where my wife and I, we got married on campus, met her at Santa Cruz Kathy, Kathy Francis doctor, and we went about our work after graduation and did war on poverty work until Richard Nixon ended the war on poverty.


And then I kind of fell into by quite by accident, a career in journalism. Which is now continuing for more than 45 years. The career journey basically was finding journalism by accident at the University of Oregon Graduate School. When we moved to Oregon after we spent a year in doing that war on poverty work in, in New Hampshire.


Great training at University of Oregon. And back then, this is in the 70s, I founded an alternative weekly in Eugene, Oregon. Moved on from that after seven and a half years to a monthly magazine. And then to a company that was very well known at the time and is much forgotten by now, Knight Ritter Inc.


Knight Ritter Newspapers was the second largest newspaper company in the country for 20 years or so. And I had the privilege of working in Boulder, and Boulder is a very Santa Cruz like town. Eugene is in a lot of ways too. You can see the kinda lineage there in my career. So I spent a couple years in Boulder, and then I went to St. Paul, Minnesota and was managing editor of a newspaper there that was a major major competitor in that market to the Star Tribune in Minneapolis. And after spending about a decade there, I came back to California in 97 to work on the digital side of the business. Knight Ritter at that point was starting its digital operation called Knight Ritter New Media.


I got to be Vice President of News, Vice President of Strategy, and got to be a participant and an observer of early digital stuff, early digital news stuff. And did that for about seven, eight years then it went out on my own. And have been doing for 15 years since then work but in a, in a field that I coined Newsonomics.


So Newsonomics is a book I wrote in 2010. I've written a column for the Newman Journalism Lab at Harvard with the same name, basically describing the greatly changing business of news not just in the U. S., but worldwide. And with great concern about what we're losing as citizens and readers. So, I've done that for 15 years or so, and then big circle rounded, I think I started working on an idea for a strong local news site that could replace flagging daily newspapers like the Sentinel in Santa Cruz.


And the flagging papers are a problem all over the country. We call them news deserts, where citizens have very little information about what's going on. And so my model, I worked on and worked on with associates and friends for a couple years, did fundraising. And in fall of last year, just before Thanksgiving, right into the teeth of COVID, we launched Lookout Santa Cruz.


And so we are, we are more than six months old. It's been a highly successful launch and we are looking forward to the real renormalization of society at this point. 


[00:05:06] Interviewer: 


Well, that's great, Ken. Yeah, you've done a lot. And do you mind if I ask when you were going to UCSC, did they offer a journalism program then?


[00:05:15] Ken Doctor: 


None. And that is one of my, I was talking to a friend about it over, over the weekend that. It is one of my continuing hopes for, for UCSC is that there will be a real and growing journalism program. There's a great science communications program and we in fact got an intern from that program working with Erica Hayden there.


The director, and we think that'll be an ongoing relationship, and of course with student media on campus City on the Hill Press, KZSC, there are a lot of points of contact there, but there has not been a journalism program since a minor in journalism. Was eliminated in the great recession about 2009. And so there's not one at this point. 


[00:06:03] Interviewer: 


Yeah. Thank you. And yeah, the science communication program sounds pretty wonderful. I had the privilege to interview director emeritus, Rob Arion and a couple of the other grads. So that's definitely a, a world class writing program that not a lot of people know about that's right here.


[00:06:18] Ken Doctor: 


Yeah. It's one of the top three in the country. 


#LOOKOUT


[00:06:21] Interviewer: 


Yeah. Thank you. Let's see. So you started Lookout just six months ago, and it seems like a pretty awesome news service, and you guys are up, you know, with breaking news all the time, and I think a lot of people are grateful for that service, and is there lookouts in other cities across the country?


[00:06:42] Ken Doctor: 


Not yet. I mean the, the model of this is to build something that is built to last, that's sustainable, that really is, is mission oriented, which we are in Santa Cruz and would be in other places. But this is the first one. So we are proving out the model here in Santa Cruz. And while everything is ahead of track it is too early for us to commit to expansion.


But we're getting, we're, it's interesting, we get calls from a number of people both in the U. S. and in Western Europe because the same news desert problem exists in, in other Western countries as well. But I think it'll be later in the year before we first start considering where, where we might expand to.


[00:07:24] Interviewer: 


Okay. And I definitely recognized at least one name of one of your writers Wallace Bain. I enjoy reading his what he writes for you guys. 


[00:07:32] Ken Doctor: 


It's great. He's been he has been an incredible contributor, of course. He is a lot of ways the journalistic soul of Santa Cruz and he wrote for the Sentinel for a long time, good times for a couple of years.


And he really has a sense of this place. And it's uniqueness and how it's changing. And so he has been a great contributor, a voice, a columnist essentially, but more than arts and entertainment, which he has covered for a long time also really culture. And he did a number of interesting pieces over our, our first few months, especially as we all lived in the depth of COVID and all the fears and all the weird issues like anti maskers descending on Trader Joe's on Front Street.


So he has been really, really valuable. And an interesting thing I think a lot of people don't know about Wallace is that he loves to work with younger people. So, our staff is mainly younger and he is beyond his writing and reporting contributions, he is a mentor to them. And so that has been and will be a really valuable part of Lookout going forward.


[00:08:48] Interviewer: 


Yeah, that's awesome. And Ken, do you mind telling us what your, like, what's your day or week look like being the CEO of Lookout? 


[00:08:57] Ken Doctor: 


It is varied. So, I mean  we're still building. So some days, like in the last month, we had some issues. We charge for content. We're very, very much on a New York Times model where it is reader revenue based.


That means a membership system. So, In recent weeks, I've had to work on that with our people as our technology change technology platform provider upgraded, quote, unquote, it's service and that, and that causes all kinds of things to work through. So could be working that kind of thing through working, certainly.


On strategy in terms of both editorial strategy, now that we're coming out of COVID. What, what does normal coverage look like? We've never done quote unquote normal coverage because we were born right into COVID. So, we spent a lot of time on editorial strategy, editorial coverage working with the editors and staff.


working a lot in the community. So we are mission oriented and our mission is pretty simple and a kind of unusual one for a news company, which is our aim is to make Santa Cruz County a better place to live. And the way we do that is high quality news and community betterment. So that means I spend a fair amount of my time working with people in the community.


Now, thankfully I can do more of that in person. We've had offices at Abbott square and I can meet with people in the square and actually starting to go to some other offices very carefully at this point. But we speak to a rotaries, we spoke to most of the rotaries in the, in the County. Chambers of Commerce.


We put on a number of forums about big issues like COVID and affordability. So we we spend a lot of time talking to people in groups, especially civic groups, that are pushing forward now and coming out themselves. And then we try to tie together the work of Lookout, both in the coverage. The business of Lookout and the events that we're doing.


So like last week, for instance, I spent some time with Matthew Swinerton from Event Santa Cruz, who is now our head of events at Lookout Santa Cruz. And Matthew is well known in the community, great, great guy, and who has the same mission orientation. And so we are now planning out a tripling of events.


most of them in person as we get into normal time. So it's a lot of planning and strategizing and then talking to people both within Lookout and in the community. 


[00:11:32] Interviewer: 


Well, that's great. And I think it's really exciting that, you know, events are starting to happen. I, you know, me personally, I can't wait to go to, you know, see some good music live, you know, in person.


[00:11:43] Ken Doctor: 


It's happening. It's happening. It's got to be partial this summer. And then this fall will be a lot more. 


#LOOKOUT ENVIRONMENT


[00:11:49] Interviewer: 


Yeah, that's really cool. And so, I was going to ask, what kind of environments do you work in? Are you working from home mostly? Or you said that lookout has an office downtown in Abbott Square?


[00:12:00] Ken Doctor: 


We've had an office from the beginning, from September September sometime, or maybe it was early October. We moved into space, which is the old Santa Cruz Chamber of Commerce space at the, at the MAH off of Abbott Square. And it turned out to be ideal space. It's been kind of small for a team as big as ours, 14 full time people.


And we are the, the largest news company in Santa Cruz County. Thank you. But it's been a wonderful space because by how it's set up, it's had these separate offices with doors that closed and four of them had windows that open. So if you remember what we all lived through people could work in these offices, they could close the door and work without a mask, they would open the windows, get ventilation.


And then whenever we had more than one, one person in a room, we would wear masks. From the the worst of it, which is what the beginning of December to sometime in January, we were essentially closed down and everybody worked completely remotely, which is a magic, I think, of media and especially digital media.


That we could do that. And then as things, as COVID started ebbing again we moved to more of a hybrid schedule with editors and business people more in the office. And at this point as we get into summer we have been more and more in the office. And it's important to us as a news organization that is based on collaboration and conversation that we do have a good office, we will be moving into a larger office, probably downtown, and that the time is spent talking to people in the community, reporting business relationships.


civic relationships, and then collaboratively inside. So for us hybrid work is not much of a solution. Of course, you know, we, we all work from home a little here and there, but mainly it is a collaborative enterprise. 


[00:14:04] Interviewer: 


Okay. Yeah. I just speaking for myself, I, you know, a lot of us have been going to school online and working from home and Can be kind of distracting.


[00:14:15] Ken Doctor: 


right. Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how this new hybrid society kind of rolls out in, in different places. And, and there are a lot of questions about it, but we're pretty clear about what we need to do. 


[00:14:26] Interviewer: 


Okay. That's great. And I think you guys, at least for now, you're in a good spot down by.


Abbott Square. I just, I really like what they've, what they've done down there with all the different, you know, the different food options and music they do, I think on Friday and Saturday and things like that. It's really cool. 


[00:14:40] Ken Doctor: 


Yeah. Yeah, that's true. 


#LOOKOUT PROJECTS


[00:14:43] Interviewer: 


Thank you, Ken. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the what to be show at KSQD, Santa Cruz, 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and I'm speaking to Ken Docter, who's the founder and CEO of Lookout Santa Cruz and Lookout Local. Ken, do you mind telling us some of your favorite projects that you've worked on in your career or currently working on? 


[00:15:04] Ken Doctor: 


Well, I would say that, you know, if we look at what, what we're doing right now we are a full service news site.


So that ranges from what we call in the field, accountability journalism. Looking deeply at issues in the community and uncovering real problems and a good example of that is our continuing coverage of the San Lorenzo Valley School District sexual misconduct charges. So we were able to break stories on that, I think about six weeks ago at this point and we have continued to talk with the young women who created an Instagram account that surfaced these charges.


And we are really pushing on getting to the public and the parents and those kids in the district the information they need to know about how widespread these kinds of charges are, these activities are, how real they are. They're under investigation by the sheriff's office and the school district, but the role of the press here is really an important one.


The role of the Press is to surface information that's helpful to the wider public. In understanding how well in this case administration like the school district is handling charges that apparently have been swirling for a couple of decades, at least on and off. So that's the serious work and the accountability work that is so important to local media.


We see national investigative reporting on places like the New York Times and ProPublica and others. As the local press has diminished. There's been a lot less local accountability reporting or investigative reporting, and so we think that is really important, and you'll see more of that from us over the next year, and it's really a prime reason to be doing journalism in Santa Cruz County at this point.


At the same time, we look at, widely, life itself, and life is not all problems. And especially in Santa Cruz, I describe people, to people outside of Santa Cruz, when they ask about what it's like, I describe it as paradise with problems. And so, the problems aspect is something that journalists should and do focus on, but the paradise part is pretty nice.


And especially as we come out of COVID, for instance, we're planning out much wider food coverage. And so food being such an important part of our economy, our lives here, kind of cornucopia of what we have available from CSAs and farmer's markets and restaurants and grocery stores. To understand the dynamics of that, the people behind that.


So it is cool for us, and it's one thing I love about journalism, and especially what you can do in local journalism, is you can do both. You can do that, that hard edge problem solving problem writing about and you can write about the people who are uniquely make up any community. 


#JOURNALIST CAREER


[00:18:11] Interviewer: 


Thank you. And what kind of person do you think would enjoy this line of work?


[00:18:16] Ken Doctor: 


People who are very curious. I think curiosity is the number one thing that journalists need. It also is true, I think, compared to a lot of other kinds of work people who have a low capacity for boredom. It is always changing work. And so it's not literature. It's not writing books. It's not long term studies and projects.


It is being a quick study. So being quick. Being curious about a lot of different things, how things work, the how and why of things. And then that's I think a personality type and people who love to go on from one story to another. And really connect those dots. That's the, the best kind of characteristics in a journalist.


And then of course today the, The business is a digital business. We're completely digital, no print, 70 percent of our usage is on the phone, 30 percent on the desktop. There's a range of digital skills from using social well to help people find your stories to shooting video obviously doing podcasts as we're doing here and and then just visually what we can do on the site.


There's a range of digital school tools and skills that are now being called for, and they are being taught somewhat in the schools, and we'll be doing some more teaching within our own staff as well. 


[00:19:44] Interviewer: 


What do you attribute the decline in today, the amount of journalists that we have in the country?


[00:19:50] Ken Doctor: 


Well, it's really two things. If you track the height of the newspaper business, and newspaper business used to be, you know, intensely profitable, talking about 25, 30 percent annual profit margins, which were the envy of people in every other industry. They were fat and happy with a lot of advertising, largely monopolies in their own cities after World War II.


And so they made a lot of money. As first TV came in, and this is how long this slide is, TV started taking some of that money. But really the major contributor to it has been digital disruption. So if you go back to Google started in 98. Yahoo, I think in 95 other companies and Facebook you know, around the same time period the, these companies became massive advertising company.


So we know they're big tech. We know they have huge influence, but if you look at their business models, it is 90 percent plus advertising. And that money probably more than. $25 billion a year. You can see as essentially a transfer from the daily newspaper industry to Google and Facebook. So it is that digital disruption somewhat in reading.


Not that they produce any news. They distribute news, but they disrupted the. Way news got distributed, but most importantly, they've taken 20 billion out of the industry. In some ways, it's amazing that they're still daily newspapers, but they are still profitable, even though you will hear them complain.


But they're much smaller, the amount of revenue that they are able to get from advertisers is far less than that, in that 20 billion range for all the dailies. And there's been a major move among the most successful, but that's almost only at the national level, to charge for access to news and to do it successfully.


So the New York Times. Which I've been able to cover very strongly over numerous years now. Started charging for content not till 2011, but today, it has 8 million subscribers. And that compares to a height of 1. 5 million at the height of print when it was making huge profits. It's profits are lower, but it's subscription numbers are going through the roof.


And so, if, if you look at this massive change, Advertising has just been hollowed out largely by Google and Facebook. What is ascendant is digital circulation, digital subscription. Lookout is based both on digital membership, a kind of subscription, and on a certain kind of advertising. But for many of the daily newspapers they have both lost a lot of advertising and really have not created enough of a good digital presence with a very strong newsroom because they keep on laying off people.


So you see this spiraling down of the daily press and that continues today. 


#ADVICE


[00:23:11] Interviewer: 


Thank you, Ken. And Ken, what kind of advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career in journalism? 


[00:23:19] Ken Doctor: 


I think it starts with those basic skills, reporting and writing, which are time tested.


That's still the core of journalism. Can you, can you can you harness your own curiosity and your own skills to find out stuff that people don't know and want to know? Part of that's intuition. Part of that's testing it out. And then secondly, those skills, those kinds of digital skills that I mentioned in social and video and audio.


And, visuals creation that really help in storytelling. So the core is, is the same there. And we, we're already working with interns from both Rio and UCSC. Get experience. It is, it is. Frustrating, I know, to have to do serial internships, but sometimes that is a really good way to get into a business, and I think it's definitely going to work with Lookout as we are doing internships, and some of those may turn into at least part time jobs fairly soon.


[00:24:21] Interviewer: 


That's great. And what about advice for someone who is unsure about their career path? 


[00:24:27] Ken Doctor: 


Test it out. A good thing about journalism is you can test it out. Anybody can, you know, find, find as a freelancer, independent contractor. We, luckily we live in a country where anybody can call somebody up, knock on their door and ask them questions.


Not true in much of the world, but we can do that. When you have a, whether it's a, student medium behind you or, some other news enterprise that helps. Because it's not just you, but test it out and find, I think, especially in journalism, I think the key is not just being good at the basics of getting information, being able to interview, being able to write clearly, accurately, and with some style, but also developing some expertise.


There are a lot of people who can write. There aren't that many jobs. If you can develop an expertise in whatever field. You are interested in and whatever field you think other people are interested in that really needs reporting Then you can find a niche and you can work that niche. I think that's really important 


[00:25:36] Interviewer: 


No, that's great advice ken.


Is there any last things you would like to leave us with? 


[00:25:40] Ken Doctor: 


Well, I would I would just say that you know in santa cruz we have a really interesting environment at this point. We're very proud of what we've done. What, case squid continues to do. K. C. S. C. We, we have our morning newsletter. It goes out five days a week and now reaches more than 10, 000 people a day.


In that newsletter, we also point to the good work of other news media, and including our direct competitors like the, like the Santa Cruz Sentinel and Good Times and Pajaronian. So I'd say, you know, for news consumers, really sample what's out there. And see what you like. And for young journalists or journalists to be really compare what's out there in terms of what people are trying to do and how well you think they're doing it.


And I think that that's a good start on any kind of journalistic career.
