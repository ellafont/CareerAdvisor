#CAREER JOURNEY

Interviewer  1:20  
Awesome. Thank you very much. Janine, would you please describe your career journey for us?

Janine Chicourrat  1:25  
Sure. Okay, I grew up in Watsonville. So not very far from where you are. And I was going to college down to San Diego State and my mom moved to Carmel I came home one summer and she told me I couldn't be a beach bum that I couldn't play volleyball all summer I needed to get a job. Yeah, it was it was devastating. So, but what I did is I went over to Pebble Beach, and I thought, hey, this could be a cool spot to get a summer job and walked in. I met the Assistant General Manager and she had gotten to San Diego State and she's like, Hey, we How would you like to work reservations one summer? And I'm like, okay, it sounds kind of cool. So I had my first job as a summer job working in reservations. And, you know, you can imagine Pebble Beach world renown and all the things that go on there. I thought, Man, I could live anywhere in the world, always having a cool place and always find a job. I'm going to go into this hotel business. So that's how I stumbled into the business. But then from there, I changed my major at San Diego State moved up to San Francisco and graduated in the hospitality degree and went to work for a company called Kimpton Hotels, so they were a boutique hotel company just starting and I worked with them. I had an internship with them, got hired right out of college and became a sales manager and then took off and became a director of sales rather quickly. And my boss at the time, he was really cool. He'd always say to me, you need to be a hotel General Manager. I was like 22/23 years old. But I also knew I needed to get food and beverage experience. So I switched over to the restaurant side of the business. And I was one of five managers at a restaurant called Colorados and spent a year just running that restaurant with five other people. And it was just it was a blast. And so from there, I got a phone call from the president of company one day asked me if I'd be one of his hotel general managers. So at the ripe age of 26, I had my first hotel general manager job, which was crazy. And so I did that for a while, but I always knew I wanted to come back to Pebble Beach. So what I did is I went and got a job at Northstar at Tahoe. And it was pretty cool because I didn't know how to ski my very first day but my boss she's like, Okay, what you need to do is you need to go out and ski with our customers. That's part of your job. I was like oh my god, how's this gonna work, thank god I was athletic. So I just got into skiing and and ran all the lodging at Northstar until one day pebble beach called me and said, Hey, I'd like to come down and work for us again. And I came down and I opened up Cos Palmer which is their highest end hotel I took over running their spa and I ran the lodge at Pebble Beach. I was part of senior staff and spent eight years at Pebble Beach, which was fantastic. So from there, I woke up one day I'd never been married. So all I did was work and I'm like I'm gonna quit my job. And so I quit my job and got out of the business for a couple years and then got ended up meeting the person I married like three weeks after I quit my job. It was kind of another funny story. I ended up going both to right after when I got married. It was like okay, I need it. I need to get a job again. And that's how I found the Portola and I've been there ever since. So kind of a long story

Interviewer  5:05  
It's awesome. And yeah, real quick was Colorados inside the Los Gatos hotel.

Janine Chicourrat  5:12  
No, They had one at one point down there. It was up in San Francisco was in the villa parts Hotel.

Interviewer  5:17  
Okay. Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about. But yeah, I had a friend who worked at the one in Los Gatos and just remember how cool it was. It was a fun place to go. And then working at Northstar must have been really nice, you know, like their village that they've built. You know, it's a little bit older now. But just what a great place to be.

Janine Chicourrat  5:34  
Yeah. And when I was there, they had just started like building out that new village. It was pretty old when I was there. But you could hear all the planning that was going on, not only for Northstar, but just all the development in Tahoe and I remember my boss had run some Valley and he went back and he's running some Valley ski resort now and he had at the time. He's like, you hear this noise? I'm like, What noise? And he's like the Jets, the jets that are coming into Truckee right now in Truckee airport. He goes, You won't recognize this place in 10 years? Yeah, that was kind of interesting.

Interviewer  6:06  
Yeah. Kind of a bummer. In some ways. Right. But definitely good for, for business. If you look at it that way. Right. Exactly.

Janine Chicourrat  6:13  
Yeah. It's  a trade off.

Interviewer  6:17  
Yeah, for sure. Well, the hotel you work at now done in Monterey, the Portola hotel. I mean, what a beautiful place to work.

Janine Chicourrat  6:23  
Thanks. It's, you know, it's a lot of fun. We, we have we have our own brewery, our craft brewery. So that's, that's cool. I would tell everybody I'd like if you find me in or noon, like, looking through the brewer saying I need something I'm probably not having a good day.

Interviewer  6:38  
Oh, man. Well, nice to have options, I guess.

Janine Chicourrat  6:43  
Exactly. But that's the best thing about hospitality. There's just so many different areas you can go into. I mean, you know, I work with this guy who I just promoted to be head of engineering. And he's like, Yeah, I was, I was going down a wrong path, I was hanging out with the wrong crowd. And I like to fix things. And a buddy of mine, got me into hotels, and I found, you know, the engineering department. And then he's just worked his way up. And he just, I mean, he loves it, and he thrives in it. And he's, you know, able to raise his two children. And, and it's just, you know, it's a fun environment to be in. Yeah.

Interviewer  7:17  
And just like, you were kind of saying, like, just a wide variety of different kinds of jobs, you know, within the hotel, or like Resort Spa, world that people might not consider, I guess

Janine Chicourrat  7:28  
Exactly I mean, it's, it's a bunch of little businesses that are one big giant roof. So I mean, you've got sales, you've got marketing, you've got accounting, if you like, you know, finance, you've got, I mean, housekeeping, just making sure all the grounds are taking care of it. So it's more than just cleaning a room and, you know, how does it How does a property look? And How clean is it? Especially with COVID? That became a huge focus?

Speaker 2  7:49  
#COVID19

Interviewer  7:49  
Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that. Was it tricky? The last couple years,

Janine Chicourrat  7:53  
It was crazy. We closed down for nine months. Here I am working side by side with all my people, really my friends and telling everybody, you don't have a job. And I don't know when you're going to come back to work. But you guys got it all get out here fast, because we don't know what the hell's going on with this virus. I'm just glad those days are behind us.

Interviewer  8:17  
Oh, absolutely and hopefully those people could take advantage of some of the stimulus and the unemployment with the bonuses, you know, to keep afloat until maybe they could get their jobs back or something.

Janine Chicourrat  8:29  
Yeah, they did. And actually, they, a lot of them were appreciated. I think they enjoyed having the time off, quite frankly, they got to be, but a lot of them got bored, too. They're like, Oh, my God, we're tired of sitting at home doing nothing. Yeah. So you heard a lot about that, too. 

Interviewer  8:46  
Yeah. There was that and I think a lot of people use it to like kind of like refocus or develop new hobbies, or, you know, just kind of, you know, defer or to appreciate things that like really matter that maybe they're before they're just so busy that didn't, you know, slow down enough to really see or to feel. So I think there's some silver lining in there too.

Janine Chicourrat  9:09  
Yeah, I remember to cruise around, come out with my husband, just because we live in downtown Carmel. Nobody was here and I might, we had it appreciate this moment. You know, it sucks. But this is amazing. We will never walk through this town again. As long as we live and see no cars on the street. Yeah. And it's just insane.

Interviewer  9:28  
For sure, you live in such a beautiful area. I used to go down there quite a bit for work and like, like earlier in the morning, and yeah, when the streets are kind of empty when it's real quiet. It is kind of a magical place.

Janine Chicourrat  9:39  
For sure. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, we're lucky. Very cool.

Speaker 2  9:43  
#FAMILY LIFE

Interviewer  9:43  
And I think you mentioned I read that your husband is involved in Carmel. Is he the current mayor, is that right?

Janine Chicourrat  9:50  
Yeah, he Yeah, he actually is the current mayor. And that was kind of, one thing that I had never had really experienced in my career was really having to work with local government. So I got to the Portola because Pebble Beach was its own entity, so it was Northstar at Tahoe. So we didn't really deal with local politics and having to work with Architectural Review Boards and planning committee and all this stuff. So when I was first at the Portola I commenced the owners of the hotel and work with the city of Monterey to renovate the Monterey conference center. And we had to go through all these steps. And I'm like, What do you mean, what's an ARC, you know, Architectural Review Committee, like, Okay, and what do I have to go to the planning commission and being married to my husband who actually served those roles? Years ago, when he said the city of Monterey, he could answer all my questions, which was great, but when you're when you're in business, you know, no one ever said to me when I got into it, that you would have to understand politics and local government and how the system works. And so that's a whole nother dynamic that came about my career too.

Interviewer  10:57  
But that must be nice too, or does it feel stagnant, that you're just constantly like learning new things, you know, evolving, like, within your career, and especially if you can bounce stuff off your husband and have that support. That must been, you know, it must be really nice.

Janine Chicourrat  11:11  
Yeah, it was really nice and well, and we were trying to get the approval to build a conference center, I'd be in city council meetings, to like, 11 o'clock at night, I'd come home and he'd cook me dinner, we'd hang out now, you know, a glass of wine. And I'd be telling him what happened. And, you know, he sat in so many council meetings, he knew exactly what was going on. But for me, it was all new. And I had to go through the process.

Interviewer  11:35  
Yeah, but how great to be able to Yeah, like to share that with someone who's a little bit more experienced, maybe in some of those areas?

Janine Chicourrat  11:42  
Oh, absolutely. Any any real company is a building contractor. So I'd come home with construction issues. And I'd be like, okay, Dave, help me out here.

Interviewer  11:51  
Just what he wanted. 

Janine Chicourrat  11:53  
 Exactly. It's been it's been fantastic. So that part's been great.

#JOB RESPONSIBILITIES

Interviewer  11:57  
Yeah. Thanks for sharing that. Janine. Do you want to share with us just like kind of what some of your daily duties and responsibilities are as the General Manager at the Portola Hotel and Spa?

Janine Chicourrat  12:07  
Yeah, you know, I kind of take a step back and go, my, my real role is to make sure everybody has the tools to do their jobs. So if it's purchase orders that are coming through looking at all the signing off on those, making sure that happens, would be you know,  one area, I have six different direct reports. So Director of Finance Director of Human Resources, Director of Operations, Director of Sales and catering, Director of Marketing, and a revenue manager, as well, I guess I'm more for tonight, and Director of Engineering. So you know, just meeting with them. And, you know we meet as a group every week to make sure everybody's on the same page. But then I also meet one on one to go more in depth with what's going on in their world. So every day is dramatically different. And I really am fortunate because I have an operations team that really runs a hotel. So I also sit on boards in the community. So I'm on the Convention and Visitors Bureau board. I'm on the Monterey County house testing Association Board, I'm on Ranchos Cielos board. So there's work that I have to deal with on a weekly basis. I wouldn't say daily, but depends on a week. But I also have, you know, responsibilities of those boards over and above running the hotel.

Interviewer  13:32  
That's awesome. And I'm reading too, that you won an award yourself of Smart Woman in Meetings award and you're an inductee into the Hall of Fame for 2021. Do you want to tell us about that?

Janine Chicourrat  13:43  
I was, I was supposed to go down to Las Vegas. And it was right when another surge came through. So I chickened out and didn't go to actually receive the award, which is a bummer. But, ya know, it was quite an honor anytime you get recognition, it's a privilege. So that was pretty cool.

Interviewer  14:05  
Well, from everything you've told us, it sounds like it was well earned that you're pretty busy. And and a lot of great work out there.

Janine Chicourrat  14:10  
Yeah, well, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  14:11  
#INTERNATIONAL WORK

Interviewer  14:11  
Yeah, you're welcome. And also it sounds like you you work with, like on some international type. Is it like tourism boards, like overseas in Croatia?

Janine Chicourrat  14:22  
Yeah, actually, when I was leaving Pebble Beach, I got invited by the city manager of Monterey to be part of what's called a government USA ID program. And it was twinning the city of Monterey with the city of Dubrovnik, in the country of Croatia. So I joined the group and that's how I met my husband but I joined the group representing Hyatt and hospitality and special events. So you would go to we will go to Dubrovnik. And we talk about land use issues and special events and hospitality and all kinds of things and exchange information of how they would do that in their country and they would come here and we toured them. I mean, literally, we go to waste management with them, it was dependent on what was being studied at the time, agriculture was another one. So it was it was really fascinating. And you know, maybe being born and raised in Watsonville is where all the creation settled. So my grandfather came from Croatia and was an apple farmer. So it was pretty special to be able to, to be part of a program that also was part of my heritage. 

Interviewer  15:27  
That must have been really meaningful. And like, what a great opportunity to go from what I've known and what I've heard it just what a beautiful place. Is it like a sister cities kind of set up with Santa Cruz?

Janine Chicourrat  15:38  
It's with Monterey. But uh, yeah, it's, but I swear to God, if you're driving down Highway One, and you look Overwatch on that whole Ohio Valley, and you go to Croatia, you see almost exact same thing. It's so similar in terms of, you know, the typography and what have you. And then, there's 1100 islands off the coast. So you can Island hop, and it's just just beautiful. I mean, everybody should take a trip there.

Interviewer  16:08  
Yeah, just a great opportunity through work to go to such a, you know, beautiful place.

Janine Chicourrat  16:13  
Yeah, I have like, I was like, pinching myself, I got sent there six times. I'm like, government all paid trip. And this is work? And they have a different, you know, typical of Europe, they have a different work style. And we do I mean, they, they're, they're not going to get going until about 10 o'clock in the morning and 11:30 You're going to break for lunch, and you're going to have a two-hour lunch and you're gonna drink a bottle of wine and you're gonna socialize and and then the, you know, then people are gonna go take a nap, and then you're gonna wake up and meet back up around three or four in the afternoon and do a little, you know, hours worth of business and then you're done.

Speaker 1  16:52  
#WORK ENVIORNMENT

Interviewer  17:00  
Janine, I was wondering, you know, what kind of environments do you work in in the hotel? Are you primarily behind your desk? Or are you out moving around quite a bit throughout the hotel, which is pretty big.

Janine Chicourrat  17:16  
Yeah. And, you know, I am primarily behind my desk at this point in my career. But and that's only because I have a really good operations team that's out there on the floor. But I also, you know, one of the things about hospitality is great is I didn't realize it till I got out of it for a couple years, I've got wicked ADD. In hospitality, you're always changing subjects. You're always dealing with different you know, people in different areas in the hotel, and it's fantastic. So if I'm sitting at my desk too long, I can't help myself. I gotta go, I gotta go for a walk. I gotta go talk to people. I gotta see what's happening now go in the kitchen. You know, what menu items? Are you changing out? What's you know, what are we going? What are we going to taste? Talk to a bartender, you know, what cocktails, you dreaming up? And, you know, it's just, it's fun to be able to, to have that flexibility and be able to interact with so many diverse people.

Interviewer  18:07  
Yeah, that's a great point. And also, you know, these great hotels that you've worked at, they're all in beautiful locations, whether it's San Francisco, Pebble Beach, down there and Cannery Row in Monterey. So yeah, stepping outside the hotel and going for a walk it's probably always just, you know, depend on the weather, which isn't that bad around here is probably pretty nice. Right?

Janine Chicourrat  18:26  
It's great. Yeah, I can I it's two miles to the aquarium and back. So sometimes I'll just take cruise down, down the path and go over the aquarium and and walk back and take a break that way.

Interviewer  18:36  
Very cool. I heard something about a new exhibit at the aquarium that has like some big, deep, deep water crabs that are like maybe six feet across or something or four feet across.

Janine Chicourrat  18:46  
Yeah, I haven't seen it yet. But everything I've read and read about it, it sounds very cool, right? I just, we're so lucky to have an aquarium like that in Monterey. I mean, it's just amazing. It's world class, and the work they do is super cool, too. Yeah.

Interviewer  19:02  
And that's probably good for your business. But I wonder, you know, your hotel is so nice. I wonder, you know, it probably is a draw, right. Having the aquarium there for people to stay with you guys.

Janine Chicourrat  19:11  
Oh, absolutely. For years, we've done packages with the aquarium and it was always our number two seller number one is the breakfast package number two is always the aquarium.

#FAVORITE PROJECTS

Interviewer  19:24  
And you know, your career has been so awesome. Do you just want to talk about some of your favorite projects that you've worked on? Or maybe currently working on?

Janine Chicourrat  19:33  
You know, I kind of fell into when I was at Northstar. I got called into my boss's office, the President company and he said, you know, we want to you to be the point person to work with the Rec Center, and we want to build it at new recreation center in a swimming pool and want to redo the fitness area. So I kind of fell into the the construction side of the business. And it was really Interesting I mean, I had to work with the property owners, head of the property owners association and also the head of the Rec Center. And my first meeting with them, it's like, you have to write the RFP for the architect. And I didn't even know what RFT meant. Find somebody to explain it to me and send me samples of them from San Francisco that I knew, that was you know, requests for proposals and it for us to be able to lay the groundwork to even hire an architect is what I was doing. So I learned so much from that. And then when I came down to Pebble Beach, I was fortunate Casa Palmero, wasn't built. So I got to go through the whole constructions of Casa Palmero. And you know, see that come to life. And then I wrote all the training materials and job descriptions and and worked with someone in Human Resources at Pebble when we hired, you know, everybody from, you know, brand new, and had to open up a hotel. And that was super exciting. So to go through that was, was pretty cool, too. And then I get to Monterey, Portola between the conference center renovation, it was a $60 million project just to do the conference center, but then part of the project was to turn out our entire front driveway, and then we decided to renovate the interior of the hotel. So trying to figure out the logistics and go through the construction. And, and all of that was pretty special as well.

Interviewer  21:26  
I bet. Did you guys do that during the closure?

Janine Chicourrat  21:30  
Now, I wish, although when we close hotel, we were in the middle of a room renovation. So that actually worked in our favor to be able to continue to renovate rooms and not have guests in the hotel. And that was that was good.

Interviewer  21:42  
Yeah, it seems like there's stuff that would have made it smoother not having it'd be so full or full at all. Oh,

Janine Chicourrat  21:47  
yeah. It's terrible. In hotel, when you're operating It's not fun.

Speaker 2  21:52  
#SKILLS

Interviewer  21:52  
Yeah. And what would you say like some of the skills that you use in your job, and you know, the skills that you learned your time in San Diego, it's, you know, that's gonna go, I'm sorry, was it UC San Diego, or maybe just on the job.

Janine Chicourrat  22:05  
San Diego State actually, and then City College in San Francisco. Two things I would say that really helped. One was writing business writing, because I do I have to do a lot of writing in my job. And, you know, a lot of times people don't get taught how to write or they don't, you know, have them and I had a really good English teacher when I was little. So that that helped me, it helps me a lot. So writing was one aspect. And then the class that I was so afraid to take was public speaking or speech class, that I needed to graduate. And that was probably one of the best things I could have ever done. Because when you get into a leadership role, a lot of times you have to speak. And you know, when I was growing up, you didn't have you know, all these shows where everybody grabs a microphone and gets up and performs. I mean, everybody does that now. And I would say your generation super comfortable in terms of public speaking, but, you know, when I was growing up people weren't really into it.

Interviewer  23:05  
Yeah, thanks for sharing that. And, yeah, what you shared about the writing, that seems like that gets shared quite a bit on the show, where, you know, that's such a great skill to have is learning how to write and like learning how to write, you know, on a deadline. And that, like, kind of no matter what you do that skill will just serve you. It sounds like.

Janine Chicourrat  23:25  
that and trying to just understand the financials, you don't have to be a finance whiz. But you do have to understand just all aspects of financials to run your business. And that's, you know, that's pretty normal. But it's something that, you know, a lot of people are in tune with. And, in fact, it's funny, because my, my sister was a finance person. And I be like, Oh, my God, I'd stick a needle in my if I just sit there and crunch numbers all day long. But I love getting a Profit and Loss report and being able to dissect it and go through it. Yeah. And I'm thankful that I have a team that puts those together and cash flows and, you know, investments, and you have to talk about where you're gonna invest your cash and things like that. Which is something that you have to learn about, too.

Interviewer  24:14  
Yeah it probably helps make things make more sense, I guess, right with that understanding. Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, Jimmy, what kind of person you think would enjoy managing a hotel like you, you know, like at the Portola Hotel and Spa?

Janine Chicourrat  24:29  
You know, I think you got to be patient, and you have to really enjoy people and enjoy the differences in people. You know, not everybody's motivated the same way. Not everybody. You can't, you know, everybody gets related to the same way. And I remember, I had this guy that was a finance director and he was a processor. I mean, he had to really think about things before he could actively engage He can be part of the process. And once I figured that out, it was like, I would go to him like two or three days in advance, and say, Hey, next time we have this meeting, what we're going to be talking about XYZ. So I get him to think about it in advance and engage. Where I'm the type of person where you put me on the spot, and I process super quickly. And, you know, not everybody's wired the way I'm wired. So I think it's important to understand that the differences in people, and then culturally, I mean, it's, you know, This ethnic diversity that everybody's going through right now, I've always had in the hotel business, because of all the different people that come under one roof and do the jobs were. So for me, I understand, you know, that aspect, but you know, that's, that's something that's now finally being taught and being learned, and people are having a greater respect and understanding for it. And so it'll be interesting to see where that evolves, as is, this story gets told, and people start talking more about it

Speaker 2  26:03  
#ADVICE

Interviewer  26:04  
Yeah. Yeah, that's good insight. Thank you for sharing. Janine, what kind of advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career like being a hotel manager?

Janine Chicourrat  26:15  
You know, I think if you're going to school, and yet you have the opportunity to part time job, just in the hospitality business, just do it. Whether you're working at a front desk, or you get a job in a restaurant, you know, I think just getting your foot in the door is will help kind of decide what you like, and what you don't like. I mean, there's so much creativity that happens in food and beverage, and you know, becoming a pastry chef or, you know, something along those lines, where you can have your creativity, that's actually a really cool aspect of the business. And I think, I think people kind of need to understand, you know, I said, I'm not a numbers person, but if you like numbers, that's fantastic. Go explore finance, and you know, go work for a big resort or a small hotel, and then you'll you'll be able to learn outside of school, which is fantastic. 

Interviewer  27:13  
Yeah, that's really great advice. Do you think Did you have a mentor, you know, like, through school, or maybe after school that kind of helped guide you in your career journey?

Janine Chicourrat  27:21  
You know, it wasn't until I went to hotel school that when I started with Kimpton, and I had my first real mentor, and then I would say, every step of the way, I've had at least one or two mentors that every company I've ever worked for. And it's so thankful to all of them, they've given me and coached me and guided me throughout the process. And it's been, it's been rewarding to say the least

Interviewer  27:45  
Yeah, yeah, I agree with you. I think that definitely having a mentor in life is just such a valuable resource, you know, invaluable resource. Really. And what about advice? Could you give maybe for someone who is unsure about their career path?

Janine Chicourrat  28:04  
Don't be too hard on yourself. honestly, I mean, kinda put yourself out there do things from time to time that might make you uncomfortable. But, you know, trying to find your role in life is, is trial and error. And at some point, something's going to click. So I think the best advice is, don't feel like you need to know all the answers. Don't feel like you need to, you know, I'm going to college. And I've declared this as my degree that I'm gonna get, you know, a lot of people get degrees and never even, you know, follow that career path. Yeah, I know, more people that are lawyers have never been lawyers, because they wouldn't became a lawyer though. Like, I really hated doing it.
