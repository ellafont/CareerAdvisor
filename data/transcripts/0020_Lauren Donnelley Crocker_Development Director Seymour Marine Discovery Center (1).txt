# GUEST INTRODUCTION

Interviewer 0:43
Today, we're joined by our guest, Lauren Donnelly Crocker. Welcome, Lauren.

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 0:47
Hi, nice to be here.

Interviewer 0:48
Lauren is the Development Director at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. First of all, can you tell us what the Seymour Marine Discovery Center is?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 0:57
The Seymour Marine Discovery Center, or Seymour Center, is a Marine Science Center on the west side of Santa Cruz. We have an exhibit hall where we highlight marine research and conservation, and we also have education programs where K through 14 students can come and do school field trips. We have touch tables where you can touch a sea star and a touch pool where you can touch small sharks, which is one of our most popular exhibits. We're right on the bluffs of Santa Cruz, offering an incredible view of the bay and docent-led tours to a marine research active lab.

# ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Interviewer 1:39
Can you explain more about your role as the Development Director?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 1:44
Absolutely. As a development director, I am responsible for fundraising. The Seymour Center is community-supported. While we are part of the University of California, Santa Cruz, we are not fully funded by them. My role is to do the fundraising. Each year we need to raise about $1.5 million. Half of that comes from fundraising activities like a membership program, a gala, a facility rental program, and our Ocean Discovery Shop, a small gift shop at the Seymour Center. I oversee all of those. My job varies each day, focusing on different aspects like our membership program, planning our online auction, or organizing our gala event, which hosts 150 to 200 people each year.

Interviewer 2:51
It sounds like a lot of fun.

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 2:53
It is a lot of fun.

Interviewer 2:54
What kind of skills or qualities would you say are important for a development director?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 2:58
Great question. I have a unique path to becoming a development director. My background is in marine biology. I'm a UCSC alum with an undergraduate degree in marine biology. I started my career focusing on whale research and different internships, then moved into marine science education. I worked at outdoor science schools before becoming the Visitor Programs Manager at the Seymour Center, where I trained docents interacting with the public on marine science topics. I have a passion for marine science and education, which is crucial for my job. I also earned a master's in nonprofit management to learn the administrative side of the position, such as budgeting and fundraising best practices.

# PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE

Interviewer 4:43
What kind of jobs did you have prior to being a development director?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 4:47
Before being the Development Director, I was the Visitor Programs Manager at the Seymour Center, training volunteer docents and exhibit guides. We have over 250 active volunteers who interact with the public. Prior to the Seymour Center, I worked as a field coordinator for Camp Sea Lab, an outdoor science school in Seaside, teaching marine science to fifth to eighth graders during three to four-day field trips. I also did internships on the East Coast, working with different whale species, identifying them and conducting behavioral analysis. My passion for the ocean has driven my career, always seeking jobs related to marine science.

Interviewer 6:30
Are most of the volunteers at the Seymour Center high school or college students?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 6:37
We have a variety. The youngest age for volunteers is 15, and we have a volunteer who just celebrated their 95th birthday. A third of our volunteers are high school students, a third are college students, and a third are community members at any stage in their career. Volunteering is a great opportunity for learning about different careers and opportunities.

# MISCONCEPTIONS AND FUNDRAISING

Interviewer 7:14
What is a common misconception that people might have about your job?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 7:18
One common misconception about development directors is that we're just out for the money. I view my job as a connector and communicator, introducing people to the Seymour Center, showing them the shark touch pool, and helping them fall in love with the program. The title of Development Director can sometimes get a bad rap for this.

Interviewer 7:51
What do you think is the most important part or crucial component to fundraising?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 7:55
Listening to your donors and getting to know the people you're working with is crucial. Understanding their motivations and what a meaningful gift is for them, not for me, is essential. It's important to connect them to the programs and take your own agenda out of it.

Interviewer 8:43
If you were to hire someone to fulfill your job right now, what would you be looking for in a candidate?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 8:52
I would look for someone with good people skills, as the job involves interacting with a lot of people. Genuine interest in people, strong organizational skills, and financial literacy are also important. The ability to put together a budget and analyze financials is crucial.

Interviewer 9:44
For those just tuning in, you're listening to What to Be at KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Melina, joined by Emily. We're speaking with Lauren Donnelly Crocker, the Development Director at Seymour Marine Discovery Center. She was just telling us some of the qualifications necessary for being the Development Director.

Interviewer 10:03
What got you interested in marine biology and marine science in the first place?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 10:07
I was one of those people who knew what they wanted to be when they grew up from a young age. I grew up in Southern California, and my parents took me to different aquariums and out on boats. I've always been fascinated by the ocean's vastness and importance. The ocean controls our climate and is integral for human survival. It's also full of incredible creatures, like the blue whale and various invertebrates. I was a very inquisitive kid, always asking more questions about the ocean, which led me down the marine science path.

# FAVORITE PARTS AND CHALLENGES

Interviewer 11:08
Do you have any interesting stories related to this job?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 11:10
My favorite part of this job is showing someone the Seymour Center who has never been there. The first thing they see is the 87-foot blue whale skeleton, and they are blown away. Inside, we have exhibits on marine science research happening right now. Recently, we had a lecture with a satellite phone call to someone in Antarctica studying leopard seals. It was incredible to connect the public to real-time science.

Interviewer 13:11
Is there a favorite project or event that you worked on that you're particularly proud of?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 13:17
I started two years ago, and the first gala I organized was something I'm very proud of. We honored Gary Griggs and grew the event from 135 to 206 attendees. We did different marketing, opened it up to the community, and it was a huge success. We raised significantly more than our goal for the scholarship fund, which was exhilarating.

Interviewer 14:13
What factors made it so successful?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 14:19
We did different types of marketing and advertising. We used our email blast and promoted the event more broadly. Gary Griggs has a big following, and we had a good marketing campaign. The event was successful because we connected it to a meaningful cause, the schools and scholarship fund, and our fundraising ask resonated with the attendees.

Interviewer 15:33
What would you say is the most stressful part of your job?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 15:38
The most stressful part is managing the budget. We need to raise about $1.5 million each year. Some people in Santa Cruz believe the Seymour Center is fully funded by the university, which can be challenging to clarify. We have to ensure people understand the need for their support.

Interviewer 16:29
Have you had any turning points in your career or times when you thought about quitting and trying something else?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 16:34
Fortunately, I've been in roles where I could talk to someone in the organization if I was feeling burnt out. During those times, I've been able to pivot within the organization, like moving from Visitor Programs Manager to Development Director, which reignited my passion for my work. Taking professional development classes or stepping away for a short break has also helped. I genuinely love what I do and want to continue working in marine science education and nonprofit management.

Interviewer 18:43
Have there been any influential mentors or role models in your career?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 18:47
Yes, my undergraduate advisor, Dr. Baldo Marinovic, had a significant impact. He was always supportive and encouraged me to pursue opportunities. In my current role, Julie Barrett Heffington, the Executive Director of the Seymour Center, has been an incredible mentor, helping me navigate challenges and grow as a professional.

Interviewer 20:14
What advice would you give to someone interested in a similar career?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 20:20
Be open to opportunities and network. Attend conferences, volunteer, and talk to professionals in the field. Pursue internships and gain experience in different aspects of marine science and nonprofit management. Don't be afraid to take on new challenges and continue learning throughout your career.

Interviewer 21:30
Is there anything else you would like to share with our listeners about your career or the Seymour Center?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 21:35
I encourage everyone to visit the Seymour Center and explore our exhibits. We have exciting programs for all ages and a fantastic volunteer program. It's a great way to learn about marine science and get involved in the community. Thank you for having me today.

# QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JOB

Interviewer 21:53
What's something that you've learned or gained from this job?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 21:58
I wouldn't call myself shy, I'm not shy. But I have had to kind of put myself out there and talk to new people more often than I ever did before. So I think my ability to just start a conversation, just be less aware of, are they going to want to talk to me or not, really just the ability to just talk to people more than I think I was able to before.

Interviewer 22:26
And then what is something that you wish you had known when you were starting out in this career?

Interviewer 22:35
Or maybe a piece of advice you'd give your former self when you were starting?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 22:38
I think, I don't know if I'd give this advice to myself. But I would definitely give this advice to someone who is coming into the development field or to become a development assistant, is to find something that you're passionate about. For me, because I'm fundraising for something that is so important to me, it doesn't feel challenging. If I was focusing on a cause that maybe I didn't feel so deeply passionate about, I can see that being really hard. And so I would say if there's someone that's coming into development, or considering this as a career that they should find something that they're passionate about, and try to go be the Development Director for that if it's homelessness, or if it's health services, Human Services, anything like that, but to try to go down that route and really find the passion. And it's not always the case, but I feel like the job sometimes follows the passion. Definitely.

Interviewer 23:29
And then how would you say this job has impacted your life?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 23:35
Great questions. I think it's impacted my life really positively working for the Seymour Center. So I've worked at the Seymour Center for about five years in the development director role for two years and three years before that, as the Volunteer or the Visitor Programs Manager. What I always say about the Seymour Center is I feel so fortunate to work there, I get to work somewhere that people want to volunteer. And that means something so every day when I get there, I see a group of volunteers that is giving up their time to come talk to the public about the ocean, and it's just really positive. It's a really positive environment. I work with some incredible coworkers, everyone who is passionate about their job. And so I think it's just given me a lot of career satisfaction being surrounded by either volunteers or coworkers that are just happy to be there. It means a lot to find an environment that you go to. You're at work a lot, you end up being at work a lot more than you're at home. It's great. I've just found this environment of really happy positive people and so I think it's just given me satisfaction.

Interviewer 24:33
Was there a quote or piece of advice that has helped you in your career or your life?

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 24:38
There's a quote that I'm going to try not to mess up. What is it? What is it? It's like people only conserve what they love. People only love what they learn and people only understand what they are taught I think is how it goes or something along those lines and I always think about that, as people, I think it's the really important part of why marine science education is so important, not just that the science is happening, but that we are here to connect people to the research and the science, because people aren't going to protect things that they don't care about, or that they don't understand or that they don't know about. If they don't know that there are these incredible deep-sea creatures, no one's gonna want to protect them, no one's gonna want to, you know, pass bills or create individual change to protect these things that they don't know exist. So I've always kind of, at least in the past couple years in the education part of my career, really focused on that quote, as something to kind of live by, like, people are only going to try to protect what they know about. And so that's my job is to teach them.

Lauren Donnelly Crocker 25:46
It's very true. It's beautiful.

Interviewer 25:48
I forget who it's by, I want to give you the real quote, so I don't mess it up.

Interviewer 25:54
And then is there something that you haven't done yet that you still want to accomplish one day?

Interviewer 25:58
I think one day, I would like to be in charge of a cool Marine Science Center, be a director, run my own organization, that is definitely a goal of mine. Right now. I'm still learning the ropes in my job, but that is kind of a longer-term goal of mine.

Interviewer 26:12
If someone wants to get involved volunteering high school or college students, where would they go to find this information?

Interviewer 26:17
That's a great question, the Seymour Center website, it's seymourcenter.ucsc.edu. And you can learn all about the upcoming volunteer opportunities, we have four different trainings a year. So there's always kind of a training coming up. The summer is a really great time to reach out to the Seymour Center because we have two volunteer trainings in September. So it'd be a great time to turn in an application to learn more about the programs that we have.

Interviewer 26:42
What advice would you give to someone who's about to go into this career field, like they just graduated?

Interviewer 26:47
You should always take the opportunity to meet new people. So if you are just graduating, and you're trying to figure out how to get the next job or meet the right people, there are many listservs out there that you can sign up for and see that they're doing blue drinks, or there's a talk coming up. UC Santa Cruz has a lot of great events listed on their website. I would just go to those talks, go to those events and try to meet people and just ask them. The Seymour Center does a science Sunday lecture, the third Sunday of every month, where we bring a scientist to the Seymour Center to talk about their research and their career. And there's always this open question time. And so many times people, high school students, college students, at the end, walk up to these very famous scientists and say, "How do I become you?" And there's this great opportunity. And it's just because those students were there. So I would just say go, go to talks, go to lectures, send emails, take people out to coffee, just try to network and meet people.

# ADVICE FOR LISTENERS

Interviewer 27:47
The last question we have for you is what is a thought or a piece of advice that you'd like to leave our listeners with?

Interviewer 27:51
I'm gonna go back to find something that you're passionate about. There are a lot of jobs out there that you can do that can pay the rent or kind of help you survive. But as you start to develop something that you're passionate about, even if it's not a job, you can find ways to include that passion in your job and in your career. So I just think I was really fortunate to have this passion early. But that would be my advice is to figure out what you're passionate about and shoot towards that. And the job and career kind of wind its way to that goal.

Interviewer 28:22
