Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Awesome. That sounds like fun.
Erika Smart: It was.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Cool. Erica, would you please describe your career journey for us?
#OVERCOMING CHALLENGES 
Erika Smart: Yeah, definitely.
, so I, , [00:02:00] kind of came to be in the position that I'm in now. In a very interesting way to myself because I would have never pictured myself ending up here. I grew up on a farm in the Central Valley. , we, my family raised all kinds of different animals from goats and chickens to ostriches, , which is pretty different.
And it was a really small community and something that really impacted my life was that I Absolutely hated school. I really struggled all through, , elementary, junior high, high school and just really, , thought that education college was not going to be for me. So, , when I was finishing high school, I was thinking, okay, I want to, you know, Do something.
Maybe a trade school, get into the medical field or something like that. But everything kind of pointed me to community college. So I started taking classes at Colbia Junior College, which is in Sonora. , and Thank you. As I started to go through the [00:03:00] classes, I had to take public speaking, and I used to be terrified of public speaking, so I tried to get out of taking the class.
They wouldn't let me. They made me take it, which was honestly the best thing that ever happened to me because it completely changed my life. It changed my perspective on life in general, but it changed the way that I learned it made me think about academia and a totally different way. And from that moment forward, I changed my major to communication studies.
I transferred to CSU Stanislaus where I completed my bachelor's degree. And as I was finishing school, my father was actually opening a small business. He's a painting contractor. And I started working for his company, helping him with marketing han resources and consulting on some other projects with some other smaller companies.
And as I was doing that, I realized, you know what, I really miss school. I want to go back to school. So I moved to Chico. And I got my [00:04:00] master's degree in communication studies from CSU Chico. And while I was there, I taught public speaking. I also coached on the speech and debate team. And we traveled all over the place.
And I had students, , participating in, uh, competitive public speaking, which was super fun. And, , all this time, I always wanted to move closer to the ocean. Growing up, my family always would come to Santa Cruz. , and camp at Sunset State Beach. So I was familiar with the area and, , when I finished my master's degree, I just decided, you know what?
, I'm just going to apply for jobs in, uh, Santa Cruz County. And I got really lucky. I got hired on as the campaign manager for the Friends of the Santa Cruz Public Libraries. Amazing nonprofit that fundraisers for our public libraries here in the county and worked with them for about a year before I Got my current position where i'm working with the santa cruz county animal shelter And  around the same time I got hired at the animal [00:05:00] shelter.
I also took on the adjunct position At cabrillo college where i've been teaching public speaking I usually teach about a class to one class to three classes a semester It just kind of depends on What their needs are but yeah, that's uh, that's my journey
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): It sounds pretty good And it's funny like how you know going back to when you didn't want to take that that initial speaking class How like by putting ourselves in uncomfortable positions like how much growth can happen?
Erika Smart: Oh my god,
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): and it changed like kind of the whole trajectory of your career. It sounds like you know, maybe life in effect, right?
Erika Smart: Absolutely. Yeah. , something I mean, I call myself kind of an adrenaline junkie for public speaking at this point, because that's what it's kind of turned into for me. , I really had a fear to it.
I mean, like, to the point of, like, feeling sick before a presentation. And what I always tell my public speaking students now is, I tell them that same [00:06:00] story that you're, you're getting an opportunity to learn from someone who has dealt with such severe, , communication apprehension that, , I've come up with ways that help me.
So hopefully I can help other people too. , but yeah, it, that class totally just changed my perspective on learning, which then just pointed me in a totally different direction,
Interviewer: ,
Erika Smart: which I couldn't be more thankful for.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): That's awesome. And, you know, and like, when I. Public speak, which isn't often. It's hard to tell, like, am I supposed to be, like, focusing on, like, maybe just one or two people in the crowd, or Sometimes like everyone just gets blurry and you're just staring blankly.
Erika Smart: Yeah. You know, I think it depends on, , you know, the context I've spoken to, you know, obviously this is public speaking. So radio interviews where, you know, I'm at home. I don't even have to look at someone to crowds of, I, I don't know, 5, 000. I was the commencement [00:07:00] speaker for both my bachelor's degree ceremonies and my master's degree ceremonies.
Yeah, I was
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): going to ask you if you were. That makes sense.
Erika Smart: Both of those were things that I had to audition for and then practice and practice. And I will tell you both times I got up to that podi and looked out at my partner and family in the crowd and thought, How did they let me do this? Why would they let me get up here?
They know how scared I am of this, but it always ends up fine. So. , I always tell my students practice makes us more prepared. Practice does not make perfect. I, we need to throw that saying out.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): And it's great that you worked with the Santa Cruz Public Libraries. I think I just, not too long ago, there was someone who was giving a speech out in front.
Is it the building right off Center Street? Yeah.
Erika Smart: Yeah. Their administrative building is over there.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Yeah. And it's nice to see like Capitola as a new library. And I think they're rebuilding the one. Yep,
Erika Smart: they have a couple different campaigns going. , I think they were, I'm not sure if the Boulder Creek Library is reopened yet, but Boulder Creek, [00:08:00] Felton, Capitola.
And yeah, the Capitola one, , that's my neighborhood and it is just, I mean, it's amazing. It definitely is. Changes your perspective on what a community library can really provide for everyone here.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Yeah, and you know for all the naysayers like it seems like there's often when I go by there the parking lot's pretty full Like people are going
Erika Smart: Yeah, something that's been.
Yeah, it's been so full. It's almost hard to find a parking spot. They're always really busy. And, , we have been having construction at the animal shelter. So we've actually been hosting our volunteer orientations off the different library locations. They do free community room rentals for other nonprofits.
So, , we just reserved the room with our library card and invite people who are interested in our volunteer orientation to the library. And, so we've been using a couple different locations and it's been amazing to, , one, get to use the new [00:09:00] technology at the Capitol Library is amazing. , but also I, I really like the idea of, , , uh, expanding community partnerships within our local nonprofits.
I think there's so much room for us all to work together. So I love, , the idea of us holding off site events or whatever that bring other people, you know, who might not go to the library, who might not see that, , to kind of show it off.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Great point. And for people who don't know, where is the Santa Cruz Animal Shelter?
#ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
Erika Smart: Yeah, we're located at 1001 Rodrigo Street, kind of, , off of 7th and I should say too early on that we're totally different than the SPCA. The SPCA is a totally separate organization. , they're amazing. They're a non profit. They do great work. , we work with them often. They're one of our placement partners, which means, , kind of like a rescue group that we sometimes will place animals with them.
, but people always get us confused and think [00:10:00] that we're the same or people, I've heard people say, Oh, you guys got a new shelter. I'm like, Nope, the SPCA just got a new shelter and it is beautiful.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Mm hmm. Yeah, I've seen that too. So yeah, we're
Erika Smart: two, two separate groups. So yeah.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): What would you say really differentiates the two organizations?
Erika Smart: Yeah, great question. , well, we are the only open admission shelter in the county. So we're, , partly funded by municipal support. So we get, , we're a county organization, right? But all of our progressive programming, like, , low cost of free spay and neuter. One of the programs I run is called Healthy Pets for All.
We provide free vet care with volunteers out in the community once a month. Vaccines, plane tick prevention, vet exams, stuff like that. All the things that we do that's community outreach, that's supported by private donations. So we have this really great program. Public private partnership. But when it comes to animals, the difference between the two of us is that we're the only [00:11:00] agency in Santa Cruz County that is accepting stray owner surrendered animals or any animal in need.
So we're serving the neediest animals in the community. , different groups like the S. P. C. A. Or peace of mind. , who we work closely with. Also, their placement partners, they get to choose what animals come into their program. So if you were. Uh, finding a stray dog, , on the street and you brought it to the SPCA, they would tell you to bring it to us because there's different laws and, , things that we need to follow when it comes to animals, , in the community.
So we have to hold a stray animal for a certain amount of time and attempt to find its owner and things like that. So we're open emission and they would be considered limited emission where they're just taking in animals as they can accommodate them, whereas we could potentially. get totally full on animals, , because we, , never turn an animal away.
Our slogan is open door, open heart,
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): , no matter
Erika Smart: the [00:12:00] circstance. So that sometimes means animals that are highly aggressive or super, super sick or injured, and we serve them all no matter what.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Okay. And do both or do both organizations help with like adoption?
Erika Smart: Yeah, yeah, definitely. We both do adoptions.
, So yeah, there's lots of different options in the community. There's and and surrounding communities too. There's just so many great, , rescue groups or placement partners that are, , taking animals from shelters like us all over the state, essentially, sometimes, you know, even the S. P. C. A. I think they've helped with, , I can't think of the agency's name, but one of those groups that go into like Mexico and , bring over some, , sick and injured animals.
And they've helped with situations like that too, whereas that's not something that we would do.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Okay, and it, it seems really cool that like, a lot of people that I know over the past couple years, it seems like a lot more people are adopting. [00:13:00] Which is great, right?
Erika Smart: Yes, definitely. During the, you know, right when everything shut down and everyone got those, work from home orders, , which we did not.
We were there. We were at the shelter. , we had a line every morning when we would go to open or just be a line around the fence sometimes because people were, , Just frantically adopting these animals, which is amazing that so many animals such great homes. , and we haven't seen a big return on that.
It's not like we saw a bunch of these animals come back when people had to return home. , so that's great, too. But yes, so many people decided, you know what? That was a really good time. And I talked to quite a few people who adopted puppies during the pandemic that yeah. , they told me, you know, I've wanted to get a dog for such a long time, but I knew that I would need to take like two weeks off of work.
And that wasn't something that I could do. , and now that I [00:14:00] have this time, it's the perfect opportunity for me to really invest that time and training and getting my new dog acclimated to my home and things like that. So it really seems like people were making, , good decisions. It wasn't just, , like on a whim.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Yeah. Just wanting that companionship. And. It's possible too that, you know, people who thought they were going to be working home long term, you know, adopted and maybe now they're going back to work too and, you know, but hopefully that I'm sure that people will figure out, , what's, you know, to make some good decisions surrounding their pet.
And yeah, yeah, I wanted to ask you, you know, like, what are your just like main duties and responsibilities as the Santa Cruz animal shelter program development manager?
Erika Smart: Yeah, it's a big answer. I probably will forget some things in it as I go through it. But, , I would say my main duties are being a Positive representative for the shelter.
I answer all of our [00:15:00] media inquiries. , I do interviews. I actively seek ways to promote and market the shelter. I do all of our event planning and I oversee all of our programs from fundraising to smer camp. , and one of the biggest parts of the program that I oversee is our volunteer program. We have One of the largest programs in the community.
We have over 600 volunteers. , so it's, it's huge, , which is amazing. We cannot do what we do without our volunteers. We serve over 5000 animals a year, which that's not including years like 2020 when we had CPU fire. , during the fire, we were helping over, I don't, I think the nber was over 5, 000 animals just in those eight weeks.
So, , we could not do that kind of stuff without our volunteers. , but yeah, it's, , a very, I [00:16:00] think, uh, a good example to give kind of, uh, A day in the life would be, I come in, check on all my emails, which could be hundreds if I'm away for a weekend or something like that. Check in with my team, we have a volunteer coordinator and I also have an AmeriCorps member right now, which is great.
, and we will meet and talk about different events. We have coming up. Try to make sure everything's really organized. I schedule out all of our social media posts on Facebook for the week. , sometimes when we have those healthy pets for all clinics that I was talking about, I have to organize specific volunteers for different events.
, And then it just kind of depends. I do all of our grant writing also, so if there's a grant due, then I'm going to be working on that, so it is the definition of chaos, let's just put it that way, but it is, it is also great because there are animals and I can go hug [00:17:00] a dog or a cat or go talk to the goat if I want to.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): That's awesome.
Erika Smart: , so it's great.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Awesome. Well, thank you for sharing that. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the What to Be show on KSQD Santa Cruz, 90. 7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart, and I'm speaking with Erica Smart, who's Santa Cruz County Animal Shelters Program and Development Manager.
And, you know, you, , you kind of told us a little bit about what kind of environments do you work in. You know, so you're doing kind of like partially, , some computer work, and then you are, you know, moving around the facility too.
Erika Smart: Yeah, definitely. And it totally it just depends. Every day is different.
And I think that's one of my favorite things about, , working in the nonprofit slash government world. Is that at least in my case, my job description is so broad. There's so many different things that I can be, , taking on as projects. And I'm really fortunate. I have, [00:18:00] , leadership that promotes me being able to use my creativity.
So, , I wanted to do bedtime stories for shelter animals. , not really as a fundraiser, just as a fun thing to do. And, , coordination with our Santa Cruz Gibbs campaign. Uh, which is, uh, non profit giving. at the end of the year. , in coordination with the good times and the volunteer center. It's awesome.
I love Santa Cruz Gibbs. , and we had hundreds of people over a couple weeks in December come in and wear their pajamas because I said for people to wear their pajamas and they brought their favorite books in and they sat in front of the kennels and uh, the dogs fell asleep. The cats were like actively listening, like watching the, they loved watching the pages turn on the book.
It was so much fun. , so things like that, or like, I wanted to do a rabbit adoption event where it was Alice in Wonderland themed and a tea party. So it's really cool to be [00:19:00] able to like, I have this cool idea, let's see if I can make it work. , and I get that opportunity to do that. , but then yeah, a lot of it is sitting at my desk and planning stuff.
, And again, just responding to so many emails, and I'm a part of planning so many different things, so it's like, part of what I'm working on right now, I'm planning our smer camp program, so I'm planning the day to day and getting the volunteers, , like, to bring in, uh, therapy dogs, or we have, uh, sleepy critters that they focus on, , They're one of our placement partners for reptiles that we get at the shelter.
So they're going to come and talk to the kids about reptiles and hane care for reptiles, which is awesome. , so things like that. It's so such, such variety. There is no. Specific day to day and something that I really, , enjoy about the shelter for me personally is growing up on a farm and working with animals in my home.
[00:20:00] I always told my parents that I wanted to be a veterinarian. I feel like that's so many little kids, , dream goal. And then you start to grow up and you realize, like, Oh, there's a lot of sadness related to animals, and I don't know if I can really do that. And for me, it was mostly the science. I just I, I just could not sit through those classes, that's not my area of interest, and so I never thought that I would really get an opportunity to work with animals, and, and also use the skills that I have in marketing and fundraising and communication in general, and that's what I get to do every day, is those things.
It sounds,
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): yeah.
Erika Smart: I was just going to say, I even got to learn how to vaccinate animals, so when we do those Healthy Pets for All clinics, I'm hands on with the animals, assisting the veterinarians, and stuff like that, which I never thought I would do.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): That sounds like a dream job for an animal lover, which you sound like you definitely are.
And you shared in an email to me a picture [00:21:00] of your bulldog. Was it Bentley? Yeah. Who looks like a Boston Terrier, uh, Boston Terrier, but definitely a, you know, beautiful dog.
Erika Smart: Yeah. Yeah. He's a good boy. , yeah. He's almost 10 and we've had him for, About nine years. Someone was rehoming him and I was, uh, very young and in fact, I need this dog, and I did need him.
I just, young me did not need him. French Bulldogs are, they are, you know, I could spend an hour talking about Brachycephalic breed animals, but they're so cute and they're so popular, but they have just, Nightmarish medical situation. So be careful
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Okay, and yeah, you brought up the uh, you know with the czu fires and I was I feel like I was fortunate to go down there and interview a bunch of people and a lot of the all the volunteers that Stepped up and were taking care of the animals down there including when you mentioned reptiles There was this guy and he had like these massive turtles and like just so many different, you know I got to see all [00:22:00] these awesome reptiles.
It was really cool how the community stepped up But i'd imagine that like you you I think you you  touched on it that you know It must have been difficult for you guys there, you know with the influx of just so many Animals needing shelter, right?
Erika Smart: Absolutely. And to top it off, I mean, I think this is how the whole community felt, right?
Like we had been in the midst of COVID and everything shut down and we're not supposed to be close to each other. But now we are just jam packed with animals and it's, , smoky outside and we are having to, you know, , like my husband had to come to the shelter and help us build, uh, big dog kennels so that we had more housing for chickens.
There was just hundreds and hundreds of chickens. , but yeah, it was like, it just, I think, compounded everything, you know, having that happen. And, , like most places, we were short staffed, , because of the pandemic. And, [00:23:00] , that made it even more important for us to have. Those amazing volunteers. We have these two volunteers that Nancy and Brian, , they are Amazing.
I don't know what I would do without them. , they worked alongside us every day, 12, 14 hour days, 15 days in a row when the fire first started. And it just it's people like that that make it possible. You know, our staff, we go above and beyond to take care of the animals. We were all kind of referring to it as club med for the Uh, evacuees, animals that were staying there because we moved out all the shelter animals.
We got them all into foster. So there were barely any shelter animals actually at the shelter. It was mostly owned animals. So our volunteers and staff were taking out their dogs, getting them out multiple times a day, getting the cats out and socializing them, hanging out with them, cleaning their kennels.
, we had It was like our [00:24:00] break lunchroom area was an aviary. There were so many birds, so many exotic birds in there. , we would turn on music and have little break stage parties, uh, with the birds.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Oh, that's great.
Erika Smart: , And the garage was full of exotic reptiles. It was the place where we could keep it the warmest.
So we have those giant tortoises, snakes. It was just, it was wild. Well, yeah,
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): thanks for all the volunteers and for all the 600 volunteers that it sounds like you continually have. And just for the work that you guys do on a day to day basis, it's, it's really great. And Erica, I wanted to ask what kind of advice or resources can you give to someone who is unsure about their career path?
#CAREER PATH
Erika Smart: Oh, that's a really good question. , You know, looking back on it, I feel like it's I just wish that I would have gone with the flow a little bit more because everything ends up just working out. Really take advantage of the opportunities that are there. Presented to you, especially while you're in school.
I think there's so many [00:25:00] great opportunities, , that can help build that resume to make your dream job a real possibility. I, uh, still for for this job, even, , used a lot of my event planning examples that I had from my time working at the radio station on at the college campus where I was working 40 plus hours a week.
But only paid for like 20, you know, and I was doing, you know, it was mostly an internship, but those skills that I used and developed in that position and, uh, great references that I was able to get from that really, , I think propelled me forward. So I would say go with the flow, take those, , experiences that you can, , so that you can utilize them in the future, I think is really important.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Yeah, that's great advice. Eric, I just want to thank you so much for taking your time to provide all this wonderful and inspirational information for us and our [00:26:00] listeners.
Erika Smart: Definitely. Thanks so much for having me. Yeah.
Interviewer (Patrick Hart): Is there anything else you want to leave us with?
Erika Smart: Uh, if anyone's looking to adopt an animal, Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter, scanimalshelter.
org. You can view adoptable animals, sign up to donate or volunteer, however you want to get involved. But, , and if you're not wanting to work with animals, uh, volunteer in your community. Work with another non profit. There's so many great ones.
