# INTERVIEW INTRODUCTION


Interviewer  0:00  
You're listening to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. My name is Nick and I am an intern at Your Future Is Our Business, a Santa Cruz County nonprofit which helps students ages 10 to 18 Explore Careers and start their career journey. We provide career expos panels, guest speakers and more activities to help youth explore careers. today. I'm here with my other hosts, Melina. 


Hello, everyone, our show What To Be highlights the career journeys of inspirational people in Santa Cruz County, if you've ever thought, hmm, how did they get that job? Or what does that job really like? Then keep on listening. We would like to remind listeners that the opinions expressed by today's guests do not necessarily reflect this career in its entirety. 


# CAREER INTRODUCTION


Today, we're joined by Rod Caborn, who is an event producer and fundraising consultant, as well as the owner of First Class Fundraising. Can you tell us what your career entails? 


Rod Caborn  0:48  
Certainly. In a nutshell, I raise money by creating community and exposure to nonprofits, schools, and other organizations that survive by raising money. So I do events for these organizations. Not only do I prepare them and do the consultation for them, but I actually have the good fortune to co-host them in many cases, because I am a professional auctioneer and professional emcee. 


So it's very, very gratifying that I can help them in terms of creating the concept for their event. And of course, to actually handle the event for them or with them as well. 


Interviewer  1:28  
And so you said two things that I want to point out. So you build community for events, and for fundraising. How do you build community and what goes into an event? 


Rod Caborn  1:37  
Sure, well, for an event itself, and most of these events- in fact, the vast majority are for nonprofit organizations. So they have a community, they have a constituency. But of course, they have to get people to show up. So a lot is just inviting people or creating something that is interesting, and engaging and exciting for people to come and show up to. 


And then once you have people together, and in the event itself, if you can really articulate what it is that the organization does, and why it is so important. The goal is, of course, to engage those who come such that they feel they'd really like to be a part of it, like to get involved, which ultimately is not only participation, but financial participation as well. 


Interviewer  2:24  
How would you, say if you had an event, how would you get me to come? 


Rod Caborn  2:29  
So I do a lot of auctions, for instance. And so obviously, their fun inherently, an auction can be a great time. And typically all of the items are donated by members of the community. They're more likely to be holidays and meals and sort of event that in and of themselves that catch the imagination of the people. And so it's interesting to come and be a part of that and to witness it as well. So that would be one way. 


And then others, I do athletic events, for instance, sponsored walkathons, jogathons, bike rides, any number of things, pet shows, it can be, quite literally anything. So provided as something that's interesting to the community, then, of course, you need to market it and get some excitement generated that way. And then invite all of the constituents to come along and enjoy. 


# HOW THEY STARTED


Interviewer  3:27  
So how did you start first class fundraising? And maybe how long has it been going on? 


Rod Caborn  3:32  
Well, it's the 25th year, so I'm really thrilled about that. Yes. And it started entirely serendipitously. I went back to school to get my Master's I wanted to teach. So I got a master's in linguistics. And just before I finished up, part of my work was to do some teacher training at local high schools in San Jose. And I was blown away at how here we were in what was then the sixth biggest economy in the world. And we had no resources whatsoever. I had classes where I was quite literally signing up for a photocopy so that they could evidence the fact that that was six cents, or whatever it was at the time. And we were sharing books and so forth, which was completely and totally foreign to me as an English person living here. I had no idea how that was. Yes, I mean, everything is paid for over there. And so it was just kind of strange to me. 


Anyway, I was going through all of this trying to get my head around it. And at that same time, again, isn't entirely random, but I used to be a professional rugby player back in Europe and I was still playing rugby here. It was amateur, and I was representing the western coast in a big, big tournament that was taking place in the Midwest, and I just happened to be the roommate of a guy who did fundraising for schools. 


Interviewer  5:00  
Oh! So that's how you got into...?


Rod Caborn  5:03  
That's how I got into it. There was no such thing as school fundraising over there. So we talked about it. And, you know, just over the course of two or three days, we each shared what we did and got to know each other a little bit. And I called him out a couple of weeks later. And I said to him, you know, "Jeff, I'm really intrigued in what you do. I wonder if we could sit down and talk a little bit more about it?" And he just basically said, "Yeah, are you serious? Because we are looking for someone in Santa Cruz." And he said, "My manager is going to be flying into San Jose International Airport going somewhere else, if you would like for me to set up a meeting with him? I could do that." Sure. I had a one hour interview at the airport. And I'm a fundraiser just like that.


# EXPERIENCE


Interviewer  5:49  
Just like that. And you pretty much had no experience inside from the rugby thing right?


Rod Caborn  5:54  
Not at all. I mean, I have a an undergraduate business degree. But in terms of doing assemblies in front of schools, and just doing any of that, no, I had absolutely no qualifications whatsoever. But I was certainly excited by it obviously, why I went back to teach was I was interested in working with kids. 


And it just it made perfect sense when he said, well, what we're raising money for is things like theater productions, or art programs or after school sport, you know, all of the things that I feel so enriching about education, that apparently were not being taken care off and continued not to be taken care of, by, by mainstream taxation, or, you know, by our governments and agencies, in funding schools.


So it's still to this day continues that if you want these kinds of opportunities for kids, you need to raise money for it. So anyway, the fact that I would work with kids and raise money to enhance the quality of schooling, that was massively interesting to me. So I worked just briefly for a year with this company, which was a corporation. It was bought out by its nemesis and I had done enough to know that I did not want to work with them. So I just started out on my own. So that was, well, 25 years ago. Long winded answer to your question, but I think it's important, you know, just because, in my experience, so many jobs and so many careers are just coincidental, serendipitous, you just fall into it.


Interviewer  7:32  
So for my position, I coordinate the annual luncheon for YFIOB and we have 240 guests, and something always goes wrong. Can you tell us about a time where you plan an event and something went wrong? Or what you what you do so nothing goes wrong. Well, and what elements go into planning an event?


Rod Caborn  7:54  
Absolutely. And yes, I in when I started out, of course, it's somewhat nerve racking when I became an auctioneer, for instance. I had a 14 day course. And then came home and then-


Interviewer  8:10  
14 days, that's it? 


Rod Caborn  8:11  
Yeah, and then I was an auctioneer and I was in the Hyatt Regency in front of 300 people in the middle, if you can picture a dance floor with a podium in the middle of it, and there I was. Go auction, right? But to you, if you put yourself out there you learn and learn quickly. 


# LEARNING FROM MISTAKES


So in answer to your question, sure. I remember an event and this was just a fun event. It wasn't even part of my work at the time. But my wife went to Harbor High School and they were having a reunion. And their emcee and keynote speaker canceled very late on so they wanted to do something and anyway, my wife came up with the idea that maybe I should show up as someone who went to Harbor High School who will no one by definition, no one will remember, but posing as someone and see if you know when the people say "Oh, I didn't recognize you! Oh that's how you turned out!" So that was an I thought, oh, this is great fun. I'm going to do this. 


Interviewer  9:12  
A little bit of acting, right?


Rod Caborn  9:13  
Absolutely. It was pure acting and you know, I had something of a script and was really excited about it. 


Interviewer  9:19  
But wait, your accent? 


Rod Caborn  9:21  
Well, I know and but that was gonna be part of the fun of it. "What do you mean you don't remember me? I was the the lone English guy you don't remember me?" Saying "Yeah, can't you remember that? That particular football game against SoCal when I ran on the field, you don't recall that?" 


Right, all of that stuff. So anyway, I had all of this in my mind. But unfortunately, we went to a hotel where the AV was very poor to say the least. And of course-


Interviewer  9:50  
What's AV?


Rod Caborn  9:51  
I'm sorry, the audio visual. So the mic was pretty sketchy at best. And it was a very excitable group in that they were there meeting people they hadn't seen for 10, 20 years. And so they were all talking. And it was really difficult to get people's attention right off the bat. And then, so I started off on this, and there was a little bit of interest at first, but because the microphone was so limited, then over time people just couldn't hear, and they kind of tuned out. 


And my big mistake was, I just kind of soldiered on, and I was on mic, and I kept on talking. And I was, I felt that at some point, they get on board. And so and that's that cringing moment, you know, when you see a comedian who's not doing very well on stage or whatever it is, it's that moment. But it was a really informative moment in my career, I just, you know, I felt very embarrassed, but not that anybody cared, and it really wasn't. But for me, it was a thing, it was a tremendous learning experience. 


And so in answer to your question, when things go wrong constantly, that's the only constant- is that there will be things that go awry. But awry, in the mind, it's relative, it is all relative. And so over time, and you know, it takes a little experience, but I always engage with humor about this. If something goes wrong, then I'll include everybody and, and just let them know that it's going on. And let's see how we can find come up with a different means of, of getting to where we want it to go. And just make it as fun and think on my feet all the time. And that overtime has been, I think what is the most important about any kind of public relationship and I believe private relationship, that you listen, that you're working on your feet, and you adapt to what is actually happening. 


Interviewer  10:57  
You work with what you've got.


Rod Caborn  11:48  
You work with what you've got. And I like to be very, very prepared. But having prepared then after that, it is what it is. And I want to be open and completely engaged. When it comes to working in a public speaking arena, either I like to have notes or a script, and then actually read it, I don't like to do that much at all. What I like to do is go through have notes and so forth, up until the moment that I go on. And then after that, just be me. Just do it. And I feel that is the most effective. One of the hardest things to do. Anybody in the public eye, is just sort of have notes, keep referring back. And it's it always seems contrived. And it's always neither real nor well presented, because it's somewhere in the middle. And it tends to be very awkward. And invariably, you should lose your place or just doesn't seem genuine.


# INTERVIEW BREAK


Interviewer  12:49  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to our show What To Be on KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Melina and I'm joined by other host Nick, we're speaking with our guest Rod Caborn, who was an event producer and fundraising consultant, as well as the owner of First Class Fundraising. And we're learning about his career journey. 


# LEARNING FROM MISTAKES PT. 2


You mentioned that you had that event. Was that like something that happened early on in your career where the mic failed?


Rod Caborn  13:15  
Yeah, it was very early on. And I had a similar experience. Actually, I was doing an auction in Pebble Beach. And I was immensely excited by that, of course, you know, like. Wow, you're doing Pebble Beach. That's, that's one of the finest locations in the world. You know, I felt like, I've really kind of made it, you know, and it didn't occur to me to take my own equipment, which I always do now. 


Same thing, the mic was awful. Who would have anticipated that? And it was... Man of the Year, I think it was entitled, and they were honoring all kinds of people. And they'd insisted that their people would only take a minute to speak and they went on and on and on. So I didn't get on till about 9:30. And, and so these are the things that you learn. And you know, and you get used to and you're very proactive about which is what event planning and coordination is. But again, it come 9:45 when I eventually got on and the mic was disastrous, and no one could hear and no one at that point, as soon as they couldn't hear, they weren't listening. And so that was another one in a professional arena where it went okay, but I knew that it could have gone a whole lot better. And I took that to heart and there's never an event where I don't have my own equipment just as a backup.


# IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE


Interviewer  14:40  
What do you think are the fundamental elements of an event or to planning an event?


Rod Caborn  14:45  
Oh, great question. Yes. I would say obviously, having an engaged audience in the first place. Make sure that you're doing doing something that's that's special or engaging or is of interest. Just in the first place, don't assume anything. And then particularly in the arena that I work, which is nonprofits, I think it's really crucial that you articulate what the nonprofit is all about, that there is a time when everybody comes together. And those leaders of that nonprofit, explain what their goals and missions are, or reinforce their missions and goals and visions, and what it's all about and what they're doing and why it's so special such that those who come feel a part of it, and they feel included, and they feel important.


Interviewer  15:36  
And they know what it's about?


Rod Caborn  15:37  
Exactly that. Because there is this odd sort of conventional wisdom that some organizations that put on events, say, well, we don't want to be all preachy about it, we don't, we just want people be sort of calm and have a good time. And it's just a totally wasted opportunity, in my opinion. Because, you know, the event by definition, or, or the organization, is doing something special, or else it wouldn't be in existence, or it shouldn't be in existence. 


And so, to articulate that, and do so in a beautiful visual way, where people suddenly feel compelled by, and you know, this is so important, this really matters. And I would like to be a part, I don't have much time, but maybe I could volunteer here, or I don't have much money, but it is a priority for me. And I would like to just do my little part, to keep these guys going. Because I love what they're doing. All of these are simply an invitation. 


Obviously, people look at me and say you're a fundraiser, how do you do that? I hate asking for money. It's so awkward, so uncomfortable. But it doesn't have to be that way. It's more of a an invitation, as I say, to do something special. And, you know, you you only approach someone if there's some indication that they might be interested.


For instance, I work with Save Our Shores in a big way now that they're my absolute biggest client and I'm privileged and honored to work for them. And so I'm talking to people who are interested in marine conservation, they love the ocean, surfing it yacht on it, swim in it, and so on. And they, they feel that that's a really important part of their life. And, you know, it is so related to climate change, and all of the things that are so important and compelling in a broad, broad way. And looking after this, it builds exponentially that involvement in Save Our Shores, for instance, brings meaning to so many people's lives. And it shouldn't be underestimated. And it should be emphasized, I believe, when you're doing an event. 


So that's the joy of it, bringing everyone up, thanking everybody, including everybody and then inviting people to participate in a way. It doesn't have to be hitting them up for money that comes way later. And it's never in that context. As I say.


Interviewer  18:03  
As long as you have your mission, it's clear, make sure you're asking the right people, right, not just not just anyone, but having that community that you built, right? Who is invested in that cause and who wants to support that? It's not just money, but they're actually building something with the organization. 


Rod Caborn  18:20  
You're absolutely right, Melina. And sometimes there's this mistaken thought that somehow you've got to get wealthy people, they've got to have capacity, as they call it. And of course, it's wonderful when you can do that. But there are many people who volunteer, or rather, if they're impassioned, that's the first thing. If they're really into it, and they want to be a part of it, then, you know, in many cases, they know they have friends and family or they know someone or they can find a way or in 10 years time, they might be in a very different position financially and in every way. So it's all about getting people who want to be involved, as opposed to "Okay, well, let's think of all the rich people we know all the operations. Oh, well, cool. Just because they got a ton of money." You know what I mean? It's, it doesn't work that way.


Interviewer  19:12  
Can you show me an example of like a pitch or an ask that you would use? Like say you were asking me in your and I love to Save Our Shores? What would you tell me? Or what would you tell people?


Rod Caborn  19:23  
Well, it's interesting that you say in the in, in the idea that somehow I'm telling or letting them into some kind of secret? 


Interviewer  19:33  
So that's wrong, right?


Rod Caborn  19:33  
I've got some clever tactic. I got my blue suede shoes on and I'm gonna suddenly create the situation where they want to give me money. It's very different than that, Melina.


Interviewer  19:43  
So that's a wrong assumption that I have, right?


Rod Caborn  19:45  
No, but it's totally understandable. And I know you were just simply posing the question, but I would ask you a lot of questions. I would ask you, you know, to use Save Our Shores, if [I were to ask] you, "How do you like living here in Santa Cruz?" And then hopefully it would come up that, you really like being by the ocean.


Interviewer  20:08  
Yeah, haha. I hate the ocean! Have you ever had that happen? Where you ask someone you thought they were totally into it, and then they weren't? 


Rod Caborn  20:18  
Oh, sure. I mean, of course it happens and, you know, people change and they have different experiences and so forth. But then given at that point that we'll have a nice conversation and I wouldn't. 


So going back to that. So, you know, well tell me, do you actually get out onto the ocean?


Interviewer  20:39  
Yeah, I love the ocean.


Rod Caborn  20:40  
Right, and I would engage. I think listening is the most important thing, just on so many levels in so many venues, but particularly for this when you have a goal, and it's very easy. When you have a mission or or a project to accomplish or something like that to get too myopic about it and think, you know, I've got to raise money, I've got to raise x amount in a certain period of time. I'm meeting with these, you know, and let's get on with it. But it's quite the opposite. 


I think that that it happens more organically. And then perhaps, having established that you really liked the ocean, I might invite you. You know, when when the conversation allowed it, I'd say one or two things about Save Our Shores, and it may well be- the best way is that you kind of say, well, tell me a little bit about what you do. You know, I'd say that, you know, I'm the development director at Save Our Shores and do beach cleanups. And we also educate kids. And we also advocate, you know, on a really broad trajectory with regard to agencies, governments, and ultimately to the on the world court of climate change. 


# ASKING FOR CONTRIBUTION


Interviewer  21:56  
And then what's their response? How do you get them to flip out their pockets?


Rod Caborn  22:00  
Well, I wouldn't, I would say one of the most exciting things is to bring people to the beach. We do these beach cleanups where we actually collect data and it's amazing when you start joining the dots. How these things happen, why it is and how it is that we're polluting our oceans? And would you like to come to one of our cleanups and that would be...


Interviewer  22:27  
Not just going and asking them for money? Like getting them involved? Yeah, letting them see what the organization is about.


Rod Caborn  22:35  
And very often, not always, but very often there comes a time where they'll say, you know, how can how can I participate? And at that point, they're open. And then you could say you could be on our board if you'd like, or you can continue to volunteer. Or if you'd like to participate financially, that's huge. Because that ultimately is what sustains this and all the nonprofits that I work with.


Interviewer  22:59  
And keeps the mission alive.


Rod Caborn  23:00  
Yeah. And I just give them examples of people who've done this and what that meant. So and so gave us $5,000. And with that, we were able to-


Interviewer  23:12  
Make this XYZ happen, right?


Rod Caborn  23:14  
Thousands of students were educated thanks to that stipend that you got, which allowed us to employ and so on. So it's storytelling, not in some kind of contrived way where I'm trying to put together a story to...


Interviewer  23:31  
But it makes them more understandable. 


Rod Caborn  23:32  
Absolutely. 


# INTERVIEW BREAK (BUT ALSO EXAMPLE OF ASKING FOR CONTRIBUTION)

Interviewer  25:41

Rod Caborn  25:42  
You're welcome.


# COULD YOU HAVE IMAGINED THIS?


Interviewer  25:44  
So is this what you imagined it being? As far as your your job? I mean, when you started 25 years ago, is this where you thought you'd be? This is what you'd still be doing?


Rod Caborn  25:54  
No, I had no idea. As I mentioned earlier, I just, I just fell into it. But I really love it. I couldn't imagine doing anything different. Even though it takes me in all kinds of different directions. I'm an outgoing kind of person and I love meeting people and being with people. And I particularly love it in a public area where people come together, and there's a synergy where the sum of all of their energy creates something really, really special. So I can't imagine not being in that environment. 


As is often said, when people say, I'd do it even I weren't paid, which I do. I mean, I'm a member of the Rotary Club, and I love to volunteer. Because I think ultimately, it really, truly matters. And I think whatever career you choose, if you feel that engaged, you feel you're doing something very, very special, and you're proud to do it, and you feel humbled to do it. It's the right place for you to be. And so I feel that, and I feel tremendously lucky and just delighted to be in my situation.


# ADVICE


Interviewer  27:06  
Awesome. I think we have one last question for you. Is there a piece of advice that you would want our listeners to be left with?


Rod Caborn  27:15  
Sure. Well, it would extend from what I just said that you just have no idea. I mean, when I talk to younger people who have just [started] embarking on a career, you know, what even is a career? It's just a series of things that happen. And when you get too myopic around it, and don't embrace whatever is happening around you, I think you can cut yourself off. 


So trust in things. We hear it all the time, you know, that which makes you passionate, and I couldn't agree more. It is made a little bit cliched at this time. But truly, if you're not really feeling it, then be open to something that you do feel. And then careers evolve out of where you are, as opposed to you finding the right career for yourself. And sometimes that takes some boldness, it takes, you know, it takes perseverance and it takes commitment. And it takes a lot of courage to say, you know, I'm not going to do- that's the safe way of doing it. But I don't feel it and regardless of what everyone else is telling me, I'd rather just keep pursuing what my heart is drawing me towards.
