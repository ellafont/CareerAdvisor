# INTRODUCTION

Interviewer  0:00  
You're listening to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. I'm Emily. 

I'm Melina

We're part of your future is our business which is a Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students ages 10 to 18 explore careers by connecting them to adults through programs such as college and career expos, career panels and other work based learning activities.

You're listening to our show, What To Be, where we interview and highlight the career journeys of inspirational people in Santa Cruz County. If you've ever thought, "Hmm, how did they get that job?" or "What is that job really like?", then keep on listening.

We would like to remind listeners that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of Natural Bridges Media or Your Future Is Our Business. Please note that information provided during this program does not reflect this career and its integrity.

Today, we're joined by our guest, Amanda Bird, who is the wastewater treatment operator for the city of Santa Cruz. Thank you for being our guest today. 

Amanda Bird  0:50  
Very welcome. 

Interviewer  0:51  
The first question we have for you is what is wastewater? And then can you go into wastewater treatment plants and explain that?

Amanda Bird  0:58  
Yeah, sure. So wastewater is basically anything that's coming out of your house that's in liquid form. So things out of your shower, your washing machine, anything that goes down the sink. And then of course, businesses also have their wastewater--restaurants. So their dishwater, their cleaning and all of that entails. So you can imagine what goes into it like grease, toilet paper, the material that accumulates in what wastewater is, yeah.

# BACKGROUND

Interviewer  1:24  
And can you tell us about your background and how you got into this field?

Amanda Bird  1:27  
So my background, it's definitely not unique. I would say if you ask any person in the industry world, they'd have a different story, how we ended up here. No one dreams to work at a wastewater plant when they're a kid. But I got into it. I was studying Environmental Studies at Portland State University. I graduated in 2009, with my bachelor's in science, right into the recession. So I didn't know where to work, what to do. Everybody had a degree. I was working at Lowe's seasonally. But while I was studying my Bachelor's program, I really got into water. Like in Oregon, the water environment is huge. It rains every day. So it's a big topic conversation. And I recognized from the environmental aspect, it was going to be the big ticket item moving forward in societies and I'm like I want to work with water. Through that, I moved back to California, I got a job with AmeriCorps. So it's a one year term of service, I worked for Energy Conservation Corps. They're out of Watsonville. And they do energy retrofits. So reducing your energy bill by LED lights, more efficient stoves, furnaces, floor insulation, ceiling insulation, I don't recommend installing those very itchy. So I do my term of service with them. Part of the AmeriCorps program is you keep going to school. It's designed for people who might have dropped out of high school or have just graduated looking for those work skills. So you know, the economy was what it was in 2009, I ended up there with a degree, there was a few of us. So they said go back to school, I did. But I focused specifically on the water industry, I wanted a job in water clearly. And they recommended me to get certified. So each state certifies people in drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment. And so I went the route with drinking water because I found the class they gave me all the resources I got certified then after my year of service ended with AmeriCorps, the city of Watsonville wastewater facility had a job opening it was operator and training is what entry level is called in this field. And it was operator training water slash wastewater. So two jobs, one allocation, I had a water license I thought I'd get in, but they put me in the wastewater department. And I've very happy of that little mistake, because it's a great field. Really. Yeah. And then I did go back to school for my master's degree, too. 

Interviewer  3:48  
And what is your master's in?

Amanda Bird  3:50  
Environmental management. Yeah, and of course, degrees are not at all necessary to get into this field. That's why I say I'm a little different than most people because it's, it's a licensing program to get the job. So it's based on work a couple of correspondence courses, and that gets you in the field. 

Interviewer  4:06  
And you said you were always interested in water. But what exactly about that were you interested in or what made you interested?

Amanda Bird  4:13  
It's just the resource itself, what the possibilities are. Because the concept of water is there is no new water. Earth is a closed loop system. So that got me thinking, oh, man, this is really going to be the big environmental concern moving forward. We have to meet clean water we have more people, more people. Water's becoming more finite, it's getting dirtier, it's hard to get. So that's what really got me into it was just, I was thinking of a career. That was recession proof obviously. And I wanted something that could give me the future I wanted, so something that was very steady. And it turns out this industry is federally protected. It's important you have clean water, so it fit all the little check boxes for I want my life to be. And steady income.

Interviewer  5:02  
So what? What does the wastewater treatment operator do?

Amanda Bird  5:06  
So essentially, the big picture is I run the wastewater treatment plant. So the wastewater treatment plant is a mechanical biological system. Engineers design this series of buildings and tanks to emulate what happens in the natural environment for cleaning water. So just like what happens in a stream, we do it at the plant, but we speed it up. So bigger tanks, we can process the water quicker. That's in a nutshell, it's a nice version of what I do. But day to day is I'm there to make sure plants running. So the plant runs off of computer systems, programs, interfaces. I mean, we know technology-- it works until it doesn't. I'm the when it doesn't. So I'm there in case something happens that shouldn't happen. I do rounds throughout the day to make sure your equipment is vibrating, and not where it shouldn't. Things are warm, where they should be warm and cold, where they need to be cold. And of course, having knowledge of what that means. And then there's also the preventative maintenance tasks. So working on maintaining pumps, floats--floats are basically a float ball connected by wire to a sensor that tells us if it's a high level in that tank or low level. And those things get dragged up and greased up and don't work, they get knotted themselves. So we'll check that kind of equipment, test run anything, we have standby generators. So you always want make sure those work when you need them. So we tests run those. And then any process changes. So wastewater changes every minute of every single day. It's always new. So you have to adjust your treatment process based on what's coming in. So the operation supervisor will make those decisions based on lab data. Then we'll go to operators and say, hey, I want to switch that tank out and put that tank in and you put the different gates in, you get a submersible pump and crane it over there and pump it over there and sending water every which way.

# DAILY LIFE

Interviewer  5:06  
Can you walk us through a typical day, if you have one? 

Amanda Bird  7:03  
Typical day. Entirely depends on what I'm assigned. But a normal operating day, say, I'm told you're operating the primary side of the plant. Most facilities are divided into sections like that primary, secondary, field. So actually today I was assigned secondary operator. So to the secondary side of the plant, and my job is to do two rounds at a minimum. So walk through the whole area, check everything, and then log certain process information, data points that we need to pay attention to like dissolved oxygen levels. What else blankets of sludge, that's what we call the settled material, sludge. So check the level of sludge in the various tanks, secondary sides actually really nice, it's a little different in the primary side. But yeah, that's a normal operating day, a preventive maintenance day would be you go to the list of work orders and you start cleaning what needs to be cleaned and check what needs to be checked. There's also a dewatering job assignment.

# WASTEWATER TREATMENT SPECIFICS

Interviewer  8:01  
What's that? 

Amanda Bird  8:02  
Dewatering is exactly what it sounds like, you're getting rid of water. So the whole wastewater treatment process is you're removing the solids from the liquids, the Clean Water goes away into the environment, you now deal with the solids. Well, solid is a loose term, we're talking three, four or 5% solid at this point. So it goes through some anaerobic digestion systems. And then from there, we send it to a centrifuge, which is the dewatering. And it's like frontload, dry or washer, it just spins cycle all the water squishes out you're left with a material solid. It's we call it biosolid. It's probably 25% solid material. And I like a spongy cake thinking like angel food cake texture smells musty, like dirt, almost like a fertilizer. And then that material is loaded into like a semi trailer. 

Interviewer  8:53  
Oh, I've always wondered where all that goes.

Amanda Bird  8:56  
Yeah, all of that solid material and those levels of biosolids. So there's Class B, class A, class C

Interviewer  9:04  
What are the differences between those? 

Amanda Bird  9:05  
Yeah, so Class A biosolids is something that's been sterilized and gone through a heat treatment as well as normal wastewater processes. And it's safe to put on food crops. Whereas Class B biosolids have not had that temperature treatment. So it hasn't killed any of the pathogens that might be present. So it's not safe for food crops, but it can be non food crops like flowers, or animal feed. And then of course, class C is even less than that. In equality. Yeah, right now our biosolids are going to a landfill for like topsoil to their trash piles in day or to flower fields for fertilizer.

Interviewer  9:46  
Interesting.

Amanda Bird  9:47  
Yeah, it's all reused.

Interviewer  9:49  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to what to be at KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Melina and I'm joined by our other host, Emily, we are speaking with Amanda Bird and learning about her career journey to becoming a wastewater treatment operator for the city of Santa Cruz.

Another question we had is where does the water go once it's treated?

Amanda Bird  10:07  
Every facility is different of where it goes. Essentially, it goes back into the natural environment, again, the closed loop water system of the planet, it goes back. So for us with the city it goes is discharged into the ocean, it's about 100 miles offshore, or no 1000 miles offshore and 100 feet down under the surface. So it's in the ocean current outside of the bay. Other places, they might discharge into surface river. Some people will inject it into the ground, they'll either percolate it into like a perk pond, it just sinks down into the groundwater aquifer, or they'll physically inject it to prevent saltwater intrusion. So help with that barrier to protect source water wells for drinking water systems.

# TRAINING AND EDUCATION

Interviewer  10:52  
And you mentioned earlier that this is a kind of career where you don't necessarily need a degree right? But you did need training, right? Can you talk about that and what kind of knowledge you need? 

Amanda Bird  11:02  
Yeah, so to get in this field, there's wastewater treatment operator licenses, you get those for the State Water Resources Control Board. They also do the drinking water licenses too. So there's drinking water treatment, drinking water distribution, and then wastewater treatment. So the State Water Resources Control Board manages all of that. They also manage the permits that regulate what treatment facilities can and cannot do, and the standards for what they consider clean and what's not clean. So to get into this field, you need to at least for the wastewater and land, you need to take some kind of wastewater education. A lot of us go through Sacramento State Office of Water programs, they have some great correspondence course textbooks, you get the book, get Scantron sheet, you fill in the bubbles, it's very nice, very handy. So a lot of us get education hours that way. And I think you need I'm not 100% sure on how many hours but it's under 10 hours, which one course book is nine. So you just need to read one book. And then you can apply for an operator and training certificate through the state water board. Once they issue that, then you start working in the fields. And each license level--there's a total of five. So each license level you achieve through time-- time worked--and education. So while degrees aren't necessary, they're helpful in upgrading through licensing process. Of course, (unintelligible), the better. Yeah, that's how you do it.

# MISCONCEPTIONS

Interviewer  12:30  
And then what's a common misconception that people have about your job?

Amanda Bird  12:34  
I don't think there's too many. I think it's pretty clear what I do. I guess a lot of people think it's gross. And they imagine I'm covered in sewage every single day. And the reality is I'm not. I wear a uniform at work, it stays at work. I'm not tracking any material home. We have showers that I get clean when I need to. I've been doing this about eight years, and I've probably had gross stuff landed on me maybe a dozen times. So it's not. I mean, but it's not an everyday thing that I'm really. Yeah, exactly. And a lot of other people, they'll question like, how does it look like, you know, when you flush it down the toilet is? It's not at all in solid form. I can't differentiate what came from where it's just a mixture of brown. Yeah, so it kind of helps remove that up close and personal feeling with it.

Interviewer  13:38  
I'm curious to know, like, I've seen videos on YouTube, where people go into the sludge. Is that a thing? Have you done that before?

Amanda Bird  13:45  
I'm not necessarily into it, I've walked up to my knees in it. So situations we might have to deal with that as if we're cleaning a tank, that's what operators will do. They'll want to rotate a tank out of service for checking the interior structure of it and the mechanics. So they'll send the operators in first to clean it. Okay, then you might be walking around in a little bit of sludge material. But I've never been in anything above my knees.

#INTERESTING STORIES AND FACTS

Interviewer  14:13  
And then do you have any interesting stories or facts related to your job?

Amanda Bird  14:16  
I think the whole thing is interesting. It's it's a unique environment that not a lot of people think about. So I'm like what would be interesting to people who aren't aware. I really don't find anything cool flushed down toilets. A lot of people to ask what's the coolest thing you found? I think the best was some Saturn car keys. Sometimes you find money, candy wrappers come through. I've heard stories of people finding dentures. 

Interviewer  14:42  
What happens to all of that kind of stuff?

Amanda Bird  14:44  
It gets screened out at the beginning because it's just going to clog the system and the pipes and cause us problems. So yeah, we remove it. Take the trash out.

# SKILLS NEEDED

Interviewer  14:54  
If you were to hire someone to replace you what kind of skills or knowledge or a person would be suitable for this?

Amanda Bird  14:59  
Definitely science, mathematic background. Biology is a huge bonus in the wastewater industry. If you're more into chemistry, that would be drinking water. That's what those guys do. So for us, any kind of basic biology experience, definitely being willing to get dirty, you have to be okay with that. And also part of the industry is that the wastewater stream is 24/7. We don't ever tell the community stop flushing, we're on and off for the day. So it is a 24/7 working environment. So that's situations you sometimes face having to wake up.

# WATER PROTECTION

Interviewer  15:34  
How do treatment plants protect our water?

Amanda Bird  15:37  
So we protect the water by preventing anything being discharged that hasn't been treated properly. And we do that with our national pollution discharge permits that we get from the state EPA. So they tell us what is safe to release into the environment based on where we're releasing it to. So every wastewater plant is going to function a little differently based on where they discharge for us. It's the ocean, it's a little easier than, say, a stream or a reverse. the volume is a little different. Yeah.

# STRESSFUL MOMENTS

Melina  16:06  
Have you ever had like a scary or really a key moment?

Amanda Bird  16:11  
Scary was probably at a different facility. Years ago, I was on call. So I was the person if there's an alarm, I had to respond, it was one of those, I was 20 minutes down the road and chatting on phone and the other alarm phone goes off like oh no, hopefully, it's just that one button, I gotta push. There's always the one button. I go in. And all of a sudden, I see fire trucks driving. And I'm on the phone with my mom at this point, and I'm describing to her like, I have to go back to work I just left I hope it's not that stupid button, and then another fire truck. And then I start seeing a cloud. And then I realize I'm driving to the location where all the trucks and the cloud is happening. Yes, so a power pole had broken free of its anchors, and fell into a big pasture and caught fire. And the whole facility lost power. So the wastewater facility was running on generators for probably two or three days, but was a little stressful, and you're driving in something, you know, might be on fire. Luckily, it wasn't, but it was close enough.

Interviewer  17:15  
And then what would you say the least favorite part of your job is?

Amanda Bird  17:19  
Least favorite. For me personally, the working shifts has been a little bit of a struggle. It's not a normal work life thing. And other people are like, oh, it's no problem, my hours, I'm seven to three, Monday through Friday, but that's just me. Other people, they'll work swing shift three to 11, or graveyard 11 to 6am, then you got the people covering vacation relief. And every facility is a little different. So some are staffed 24/7 Some might just have on call people 24/7 and only physically there for eight. So for me, I found juggling and finding that new sleep pattern has been a little bit interesting. But for the most part, not that bad. 

Interviewer  17:19  
You said seven to three as in 7am to 3pm?

Amanda Bird  17:54  
Yeah, yeah, 

Interviewer  18:00  
Oh, that's good. 

Amanda Bird  18:09  
Yeah, that's pretty good. Get out pretty early.

Interviewer  18:13  
Aside from the fire emergency, what is the most stressful part of your job?

Amanda Bird  18:18  
Most stressful. When everything stops working. But really the most stressful is when if you lose your computer program, which runs the facility. So back in, I would probably say the 70s and 80s, the old timers that are now leaving the field, I'm coming in, I'm used to a world with technology, everything works. They come from a world where they had to incorporate the technology into how they ran the facility. So the scary moments for me is when if the computer system goes down, and none of the old guys are around to help, I'm gonna have to make this work manually. So that gets a little more shame like, okay, come on brain, remember what's supposed to happen. And what happens in those moments. If you don't have a computer telling you the data points, what's happening in a facility, you become the computer, you become the counter, I have to know this pump turns on for 15 minutes every hour. So there's this one and this one and this one, and this guy turns on every 30 minutes for 20 seconds and that guy does this. And so it just expands your brain capacity. But that's always a little scary moment. When you see the lights go you're like *gasp* come back on, come back on. Yeah, we have generators, those moments don't happen often. Okay, that's good. It's always like, okay, my heart's work.

# CAREER ADVANCEMENTS AND MOTIVATION

Interviewer  19:38  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to what to be KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Melina and I'm joined by our other host, Emily. We are speaking with our guest, who is Amanda Bird and she is the wastewater treatment operator for the city of Santa Cruz. And I want to know, has anything changed since you first started in this career?

Amanda Bird  19:59  
I would say everything's changed. It's right now the industry is going through a big technological advancement. This happens probably every 20 to 30 years in the industry. You know, colleges, universities are doing all sorts of studies and tests of how we can better remove, better treat water. Well, it kicks out to the industry every 20 years, because that's when they have the money to rebuild their plants. And we're at the cusp of it right now we're transitioning. The entire industry is starting to go into reverse osmosis. So it's a treatment level and membrane filtration is the other one, there's more than just the two. But it's a third treatment process. So in wastewater, you have your primary treatment, which is all mechanical remove, then you have your secondary treatment, which is the big push in the late 80s, that the old timers handle. And that was the introduction of biological treatment systems, micro organisms doing the work for me. Now, we're getting into that other step of tertiary treatment, which is third down the line for you're now making the water even cleaner. So you're starting to see that happen, especially in discussions of where do we get more water if you don't have other sources? So that's when they kind of look at our industry like, well, there's a bunch of water. So we're trying to step up our treatment capabilities so that it could be a possible future.

Interviewer  21:27  
And then what is something you'd wish you'd known when you're starting out in this career?

Amanda Bird  21:32  
In this career, I was pretty clear what I was walking into. The one thing that I've struggled with is I thought my degree would be a little more valuable. It's extremely valuable, but it's not a standalone. I've still had to work up from the bottom I've had to get in the muck with all the other guys. 

Interviewer  21:54  
So it's experience? 

Amanda Bird  21:55  
Yeah, degree is great. It's wonderful. It's given me a leg up, but I can't stand on that leg alone, you have to have the actual work experience. And that means sometimes you're the guy pulling the weeds. 

Interviewer  22:09  
Or getting in the sludge.

Amanda Bird  22:09  
Yeah, exactly. So it's just you got to put in the work to. Yeah.

Interviewer  22:16  
Is there anything that you found out after you had the job that was surprising to you?

Amanda Bird  22:21  
Hmm.. Surprising..

Interviewer  22:24  
Or something that maybe the everyday person might not be aware of?

Amanda Bird  22:27  
I think I'm so far removed from everyday person. I'm not even conscious of what's weird that I deal with. Yeah, I really can't say anything surprising. Well, the one surprising thing I guess I can think of is what a small community of professionals exist in modern wastewater, there's probably, I think, since the history when you get your license, they give you a number. And it's like the number of people they've ever licensed. They're about 40,000 right now. In the whole state. And so they started this licensing program, officially, I think, in the 60s or the 70s. So just think that number, it's like, okay, clearly a lot of this 40,000 has already retired. Yeah. So it's a very close knit group of people. I mean, I'm a nerd, I visit wastewater plants on my vacation, travel all over the place. And like, Wait, I've seen you wait, weren't you at that class. So it's very, very unique. And like I said, I keep saying close knit. But there's a certain camaraderie environment, there's only a few of us

# CHALLENGES AND TRENDS

Interviewer  23:30  
Have you noticed any trends in like the amount of water that is being used? or I don't know the term. Are there any trends, I guess.

Amanda Bird  23:39  
The biggest trend we've been dealing with recently is what in the early 2000s, water conservation was a big topic, because the drought situation. Well it was wonderful. Everybody did a great job at conserving water to the point that now there's not enough water flow to keep everything moving in the pipes. So when engineers, you know, back in the 1900s, are building sewer systems for cities, they're like, Oh, we got tons of water, it'll flush, whatever. And we'll set all our pipes at a one degree slope, that's plenty of slope to keep things sliding. Well, with the drought, it turns out, it's not. So more materials sitting in the collection lines. So it's creating more work for those guys to send it to us. And they're having to put water in the system to keep it moving. And then what that's also done to the wastewater plant itself is the facilities that are designed to treat based on permit and flow capacity. Well say you're built in the 50s with a projected growth of your community, they thought this place would grow huge. They had 20,000 or 30,000 more people. Well, you do, but then you can serve water to levels under the design for the facility. So now facilities are having to function in something they weren't quite designed to function in. So it makes it a little more tricky. Probably a little more fun for operators because you're not like, oh, go look in the book, see what it tells you. It's like, well, now, you got to think about this now.

Interviewer  25:11  
Did you face any challenges getting into your career? And I know you mentioned that you got your degree during the recession, right?

Amanda Bird  25:17  
Yeah. So I got my bachelor's during the recession, it was just finding a career direction after that. So I graduated at Portland State University. I'm originally from San Jose. So I grew up around here. When I graduated, I was getting temp jobs. Like this is ridiculous. I have a degree I should be able to get. No, that's not true. You have to work. So I came back to California and I just went to AmeriCorps. It was the only thing I could find that would was hiring. And yeah, through the AmeriCorps, how I found the industry. For me, it worked out nicely. But I definitely probably my junior year from my bachelor's degree, I knew there was a recession going on. So I very clearly thought about what do I want to career. Like, I want a career, I want to be able to retire, I want to afford a house. And I don't want to be in a, I mean, I grew up my father worked in the dot-com environment. And like, I don't want to work in an environment that can just cut you whenever they feel like it, I want to be a little more ingrained into the system. So my first thought was utilities like, you cannot live without utilities, basic human needs. And then that led into this water wastewater fields. But most people probably don't think that much about that.

Interviewer  26:35  
What keeps you motivated to continue doing your job?

Amanda Bird  26:38  
It's the knowledge of what I'm doing is protecting the environment. I mean, I might go to work and have the worst day ever or get covered literally head to toe. That can happen any moment. But I keep going back because I'm protecting this community and I'm protecting the ocean environment. I mean, if you don't have wastewater treatment, you don't have a city. It just cannot function. Everybody will get sick, it's not gonna work. So it's just knowing that responsibility, martyrdom, I think I've adopted a little bit, but it's the knowledge that I'm doing something beneficial. I mean, I don't have to be super important to make a difference.

# CAREER ADVICE AND FINAL THOUGHTS

Interviewer  27:14  
Yeah, that's very true. What advice would you give to someone who is interested in pursuing this career?

Amanda Bird  27:19  
Start going to Sacramento State and get those correspondence course books read and start testing and also tour facilities. Every single facility is different. I've worked at three. I've probably toured at least 10. Every single one was different. So just go out there. Ask the people see what they do. And every facility is happy to give tours. Most of us are government employees. There are contract operated facilities, so they have contractor companies who hire operators. But even they like to (unintelligible).

Interviewer  27:48  
Last question we have for you is what is a thought or a piece of advice that you'd like to leave our listeners with? 

Amanda Bird  27:52  
Look at the trades and the utilities and jobs that aren't necessarily degreed. What I'm seeing out there with our industries, we need mechanics, we need people who can work on air conditioning systems. So it's like it's yes, go to college, but also try to get some of those other skills and become more well rounded. If your dad works on tools and maybe hang out with him and learn how to use some of the power tools. That's always beneficial.

Interviewer  28:21
