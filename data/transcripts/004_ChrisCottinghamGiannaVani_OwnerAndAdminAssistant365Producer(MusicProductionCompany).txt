# INTRO
Interviewer  0:00  
You're listening to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. My name is Nick and I'm an intern at Your Future Is Our Business, Santa Cruz County nonprofit which helps students ages 10 to 18 explore Careers and start their career journey. We provide career expos, panels, guest speakers, and more activities to help youth explore careers. Today I'm here with my other host Molina. 


Hello everyone, our show “What to Be” highlights the career journeys of inspirational people in Santa Cruz County. If you've ever thought “Hmm, how did they get that job?”, or, “What does that job really like?”, then keep on listening. We would like to remind listeners that the opinions expressed by today's guests do not necessarily reflect their career in its entirety. 


Today, we're joined by Chris Cottingham, owner and manager of 365 Producer, as well as Gianna Viani administrator and student representative. Can you tell us what your job entails? And what type of tasks and skills do you use? 


Chris Cottingham 0:51 
Yeah, so, I'm a director and a producer, making variety of different content. And although typically, that means a lot of phone calls with different artists and managers and producers, and a lot of our different staff and partners that we have, ultimately to my job as the owner is to clean toilets, and that kind of literally and figuratively. In that my job is to pay attention to the details of the operation, right. So, I'm looking at everything from the presentation of the studio, to our client interaction, to the well-being of our employees, and really just paying attention to all the details. And then I mean, it literally and that I feel like that's probably one of the most important things for any business is to have a clean bathroom and be able to provide that experience for the clients. And I feel like it also keeps me humble. So that's kind of my round of experience, on a day-to-day basis. 


Gianna Viani 1:40 
So my job as an administrator, handling a lot of the scheduling, answering the phones, when I'm in the office, talking to clients, students, producers, anybody who has an interest in the studio and wants to get involved. I also handle students. So we run a great program here we teach music production, recording and audio engineering, DJing, and performance in video production labs. So I answer all questions about those different types of labs and also schedule the students to come in sit in. And I also enroll the students as well into the courses. 


# COMPANY BACKGROUND
Interviewer 2:09
So how did 365 Producer come to be? What's the origin behind that? 


Chris Cottingham 2:14
Well, I've been doing this for about 20 years, you know, and when I say this making content. You know, I started with kind of a dream when I was 16 years old, I wanted to own my own nightclub. And I worked as a busboy, a cook a server, every job, I could learn the customer service industry. And then when I was 22, I opened up my first restaurant lounge card room. And at that point, kind of crazy story, there was a bartender that was there that played a really mean blues guitar. And I kind of fell in love with his passion and his drive and his vision and his dream. And so at that point, I said, “Hey, I'm gonna make you a record” and basically started a record label. And I at that time, had no idea what a record label did. I think I paid a guy $200 at that point to record the record for us. 


But with that, I kind of came came at the music business with the outside-of-the-box approach in that started doing some very unique things. We took a 1974 Airstream trailer, one of those silver Twinkie-looking things, and we gutted it and we put hardwood floors in it, and we put a recording station and then in a video switching station, we started driving around everywhere, basically recording bands and broadcasting and live online. Now this was back in 2005, right? So imagine, you know, everyone didn't have a computer in their pocket, right? You got to be at home with a good solid internet connection. He did things the old-fashioned way to be able to watch it. But the beauty of what we were doing is that an artist or a band could come to a small venue and potentially play for millions on the other end of the screen. And so that was a very new concept. So new that it got the attention to capital and EMI and some of the major record labels. 


So they called me and basically asked that I tour with some of their different bands in broadcasts online. And at the time, you know, it was like I was getting an opportunity to work with just you know, legendary acts. Lady Antebellum, Everclear, Ringo Starr, we worked with Billy Idol. We worked with a lot of different groups to basically broadcast them live online, [Unintelligable], Vampire, Weekend, Girl Talk, like anybody in that kind of 2000s period, if you will, that was poppin'. And even some of these groups that were just kind of just up-and-coming, they weren't as legendary as they are now. So it gave us a platform and they gave us an opportunity to go out there and the funny part about it too, is like it was so new that we were doing everything kind of on a duct tape budget and we had to be very innovative right there was no answers out there as far as how to do this. So you know, here we are. And again, this dinky beat-up trailer pulling up next to these multimillion-dollar production trucks that are broadcasting live on TV and they would like all laugh at us when we pulled up like, “What do you guys do in here?” And we'd be like, “We're broadcasting live on the internet”, and they're like, “Well, who's going to watch that?”


Who's laughing now?


So long story short, you know that that I think really kind of cut my teeth and gave me an opportunity to really get into the music business. And then from there, I've owned several different studios, and this one that we're currently in, it's about 3500 square feet, it's kind of Disneyland for creators, right, in that we have two different control rooms, five isolation rooms, and giant live room. And what we do here is really try to provide a support for the creative community. And that might be artists that are looking to record that might be videographers, that are looking for a space to use to edit, you know, and really, also just provide a community. I feel like right now, the world is so isolating because of the internet, there's very few face-to-face interactions. And I think that's a really important part of creativity. So we try to provide that space as well. Yeah. And here we are current day.


#DAY IN THE LIFE
Interviewer 5:58 
So then in addition to providing the space, do you go into the studio and help them with things? What does your week look like? 


Chris Cottingham 6:05
Yeah, my typical week, I mean, it's interesting, because I started all this to be able to do more music, but these days I do very little music. And that, you know, we've created quite the operation here. And so it's business, and we have to run it day-to-day. But I still find it important to, you know, kind of integrate in with the classes. Everything that we do here is kind of based on somewhat of a three-pillar system of training production in studios. And we integrate all of that into one. So what's unique about what we do is that we'll bring in these different artists that we're working with, and some of these artists are platinum-selling recording artists, big names, and we provide an opportunity for the students to work with them hands-on. And ultimately what that's doing is building up their resume, right, it's building up their resume and building those opportunities for them to build their entire career off of. So a lot of what we do is integrate the training sessions in the labs and what we do with some of the different artists that come through here. We've been blessed to be able to have some of our students have an opportunity to maybe have their beats placed with bigger artists that are out there, putting their music out there in the world. And again, just kind of create that synergy between those three different pillars. 


My specific role, again, is to pay attention to the details, because there's so much that goes on here. And there's so many different things that are really in three different departments, you know, I have to kind of bounce between all those different things and pay attention to details and make sure that balls don't get dropped. 


Interviewer 7:27
And then John, what does your week look like?


Gianna Vani  7:31  
So, I work Tuesday through Thursday, currently, I'm looking at maybe scheduling some more time. So typically, if you call the phone, I'm here at the studio, while I'm working, I'll be answering, you'll be talking to me on the other line. So first, I come in and I check the calendar and I see who's scheduled and I assure to call everybody that day that is either coming in for an interview for class, any new students especially, and just remind them they have an appointment with us, that's my first. And then I go through the phone and answer any missed calls, recall anybody or text anybody that has hit us up recently, and I have not had a chance to talk to yet. 


And then after that, right now, I've been spending a lot of time reaching up students and working in the student program that we have here and pulling in more students. 


Chris Cottingham 8:20 
Yeah, it seems like lately too the amount of students that are showing interest in what we do is has increased three times from last year. We used to go out and make presentations in high school and maybe get 10 different people that were interested now, like the numbers are closer to 40, 50 different people, you know


And just to kind of talk up Gianna for a minute to like, you know, being an administrator in today's world is an unbelievable job and that it's not just answering phones, right? It's phones, it's email, it's Instagram, it's Facebook, it's Snapchat, it's all the different methods of communication text, you know, I mean, and so it's a constant, like kind of bouncing between those different things, and trying to find it like what's the best way for each individual person to communicate? And then managing all that data, which is a crazy task, you know, just to kind of quarterback all that. So, yeah, I mean, I pay attention to the details, but she's the glue that holds it all together.


Interviewer 9:14  
Is it just you two on staff? 


Chris Cottingham 9:16
Oh, no, we have lots of other people that are here and we have great instructors. Can I namedrop a little bit because if I'm going to namedrop, I want us to give them a shot. Okay, yeah, we got Peter Coleman. We got Josh Brown, we got Ian Pillsbury, we got our boy Troy, you know, and again, just like a great staff of people not to mention John, our video guy that works his butt off every day. All these people, again, are just part of the team that we have here. In addition to that, we have probably about 30 or 40 different engineers that have gone through the program that are part of our community and part of our team here. So they still come in on a regular basis. 


A lot of our students transition to being contractors and running their own businesses, and they'll still come back to our studios and rent our studios. We have basically an alumni rate that we offer them to come in and use the facility to be able to work on their own projects. So a lot of those guys or I should say, guys and girls, are still part of our team and come back here on a regular basis. 


# PRIOR EXPERIENCE
Interviewer 10:14
And for those who are just tuning in, I just want to let you know, you're listening to our show What to Be on KZQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Melina and I'm joined by our other host, Nick. We're speaking with Chris Cottingham, who is the owner/ manager of 365 Producer, as well as Gianna Vani, who is the administrator/ tudent rep. And we're learning about their career journey. And with that, I want to ask, did you have any education or formal training before you got into these positions? 


Chris Cottingham 10:45
Yes and no. And when I say that, like, I started, honestly, I think what I realized now to be the wrong path, and that I dropped out of high school, education was not important to me, I kind of learned from the school of hard knocks. And for those that are there, post Internet, what that means is actually getting out face to face and networking with people and learning kind of by doing. And so that is what I did for the first 10 years of my career. And I worked my way, all the way up to an executive position to where I had, you know, 32 employees, eight different business partners. And at that point, realize that amongst all of my partners, every one of them had a degree. And I was the only one that didn't. 


Now, where I started to see that limit me is the communication gap between some of the different people like you know, the producers, the engineers, the terms what everybody was talking about, you know, and so I felt like it was really important to go back and kind of learn that terminology. So then I went back to school, 10 years later, got my degree in Multimedia design and production, and learn then that education is a lifetime commitment, especially in today's day and age that we live in, things are constantly changing, technology is doubling at a rate of every 12 months, if not more now. And so we always have to keep up to date on education, because oftentimes, like what students are learning in school, by the time they graduate, it's out-of-date information. So I think it's got to be like kind of a, you know, a lifetime commitment to education, and also really, what inspired our training program. 


Giana Vani 12:15 
I could say that, yeah, I've had a good deal of prepping for this position. I was an administrator for about seven years from my parents company. The only difference between their company and this one is there's no text messages. No, you know, other sources of internet, right? So it's just answering phones, and I worked for a Fire and Water Restoration company. So the phone's not ringing every five second, yes, which is different as well. But it did prep me in a way I did do a lot of filing a lot of organizing, a lot of creating spreadsheets and things like that. So I think that definitely prepped me for this this position. 


As far as student representative, I'm very talkative and very friendly. I'm very social as well, I spent a lot of my my time in college and in high school, being very social. And I feel like that's what helps me work with students and communicating with them in understanding what they need and how to help them, and other things like that. And I also have a great love for music, which makes this job amazing because I get to stick my head in the door and anyone and check out what's going on, you know, every day. 


Chris Cottingham 13:12 
I think it's an interesting story. I mean, not to interrupt, but I think he's telling me kind of how like, how did you start here? Yeah, what did you like that story, I think is a great story to tell that I think listeners need to hear for sure. 


Giana Vani 13:25
So I was in college, and I knew I wanted to do something with music, I loved music, and I didn't want to go to work every day, not liking my job. And I was a business major and decided to change my career path. And so I created my own major and took some music classes. 

Intewrviewer 13:41
What was your own major? 

Giana Vani 13:43
So it's a program at the college that I went to where you pick three different departments and you pretty much create your own title. I went to school in the Midwest don't go there. No. It's a great school. But the Midwest is boring. Stay California if you can. 


But yeah, so the three categories that I ended up going with his poetry, and I emphasized and lyric writing, I love to write lyrics and things like that. Music entrepreneurship. So it taught me how to market myself as an independent musician and how to work with nonprofits and things like that. And then I also had nine credits left. So I just took like arts classes and just made an Art section of my degree that really didn't mean much but and I took a lot of recording and audio engineering classes in college and I really loved them. And I knew it was something that I really wanted to dive into. I used to make beats with my mom when I was a cheerleader in high school. And that's kind of how I got started into making music. Yeah, so when it came time to find an internship, I just started looking in California because I only wanted to move to California and started applying to studios in the area. And Chris was one of the first people to call me back and we had a phone interview and I just we hit it off right away. He's such a cool dude. And so I threatened him by telling him I would pack my bags and move out to California in a month to do the internship and, and he tried to call my bluff and say, you know, I'll see you when you get out here if you do, and I showed up and and made things happen. 

Chris Cottingham 15:08 
Yeah. And let me tell you to like there's a lot of there's a lot of people that apply for internship program here from all over the world. And you know, so I sometimes get those emails that are like, “Hey, I'm thousands of miles away, but we'd love to come and intern for your company”

# A GOOD INTERN
Interviewer 15:20
What separates like a good intern versus– 


Chris Cottingham 15:25
Well, that's a that's a really good question. You know, I should say that the number one thing that, again, is what got her the position that she showed up, right? You know, I mean, really, like that's, that's what it comes down to is like, you got to show up, you got to be there, you got to be present. You know, I tell a lot of people that want to get involved in what we do. It's like, the best way is to be here. Because if you here, that's when things happen. Right? Yeah. And very quickly, you get integrated into all sorts of fun projects and different things because you're physically here in the building and in the space. 


So that's where it starts. And I think that's also to a good, good bit of advice for anyone that's looking to like explore different opportunities, just show up, you know, just being there, you're going to learn about, again, what what's there in and where you fit in that, you know, world. But you know what, what makes a good intern versus a bad intern or a bad employee? 


Gianna Vani 16:17
I'd say efficiency. 


Chris Cottingham 16:19
Yeah, I think efficiency, I think organization, I think dedication and passion and drive and willingness to do like the jobs that other people aren't. You know, we have we have a series of kind of do's and don'ts that we go through in our internship orientation there where we talked about, like, some pretty, I don't know, obvious things. So, don't write so don't approach some of our clients and artists that we have here and ask them for free promotional CDs or DVDs. I mean, look, I still fan out. Like, there's certain people that I mean that like, I'm like, Oh, my goodness, I can't believe I'm in this room. But I try to keep my composure, because ultimately, like what the artists are here to do is get away from that, right? This is the creative sanctuary, we have to create a place that like, they're not having to deal with all that they deal with plenty of that. Right. So like, once they get here, we have to be able to try to provide that that atmosphere that allows them again, that safety of their creativity. 


And then, but back to the you know, again, what makes a good intern versus a bad intern? And I think she hit the nail on the head as far as efficiency. But, you know, there's, there's, we've had so many different people from different walks of life come through here. And it's not always what you would immediately think it is meaning like, we've had people that have had unbelievable experience, when it comes to audio video production and content creation, they maybe even have gone to like some of the top schools to learn that. But what they don't have is that again, that drive in that passion, that makes all the difference in the world, I'd rather work with somebody that knows absolutely nothing about what it is that we do, but has that drive in that passion, and really wants to do this, because, honestly, it's a rough road, like what we do takes a lot of, you know, just get up and go in and, you know, hard, hard work. 


I had somebody recently asked me, I think it was maybe an intern that was here that said, what's the one bit of advice that you have? And I said “don't qui”t, right, like, that's the that's don't quit, don't quit, because you know, I've been doing this long enough to watch people jump off the Titanic, if you will, and in the boat wasn't sinking, you know, and so like, you know, we rode off into the sunset there, you know, in icy waters. And it's so hard because like, look, the world is created in such a way to where I think it like it, you know, it says, you know, hey, I want to be an artist, or I want to be a musician, or I want to be somebody that's creative in the whole world is saying, don't do that, that doesn't make any sense. It's not logical, etc, etc. Well, you know, here we go, flash forward, 2020 we're living in the future. Now. Content is king content is the most important thing in the world. So these people are ultimately learning the skill sets that apply to every major corporation that's out there, I think the world has changed and that this is a very, very, very rewarding career in that we get to do a lot of really cool things. But now that demand for creativity, all these major corporations have that demand, they need to meet that demand. And so like art students end up getting hired at Facebook making $400 a day, you know, like they, they go off into the world and end up doing these, you know, wonderful careers that start with music. Start with the creativity of doing something fun, but evolve until Yeah, involved into that. So yeah, just keep pushing. 

Interviewer 19:50
For those of you who are just tuning in, you're listening to What to Be KSQD 90.7. FM, Santa Cruz, and I'm Nick and I'm joined by Melina and we're speaking to her Chris and Gianna, and learning about their career journey as administrators and managers, and a manager of 365 Producing. 


And we were just talking about what makes a good intern or employee versus a bad intern or employee. Anyone else? Have you had any experiences or previous jobs? That wouldn't really, you know, downs out and terrible? Or what do you think makes a good leader manager? 


# BAD EXPERIENCES
Gianna Vani 20:24
I think that honest leaders is my number one. I worked a job once in high school, and I was selling newspapers door to door. And they told us to come up with a fake college pitch and sell these newspapers. What do you mean by fake college pitch? Like, it was almost like I'm a college student and like, This money will go towards my college. No. So I thought it was legit, that my grandmother bought one of the newspapers, and I forgot it. So I quit. Oh, yeah. So the whole thing was a scam. And you know, and saying that what I mean by that is just, you know, being straightforward with your employees and being comfortable in the workspace. I was picked up in a van. I mean, it sounds weird, but like, a company van, and it had a logo on the side. And you know, not only the 30 van, right, I thought it was an official business. And like they they did a really good job at lying. And my mom told me, it was a waste of my time in a bad job. And it was my first job away from my parent's business. So I was like, I'm determined to do this. Yeah, like, I'm gonna run with this. So yeah. 

Interviewer 21:22
Have you had any bad experiences?


Chris Cottingham 21:24  
Bad experiences, bad jobs within this career or either bumps in the road? Yeah, I've had lots of bad experiences.  Well, I should say this, that. I want to throw this out there for all my people out there that are working hard in their day job. And again, trying to pursue creativity at night. Like, I've had a lot of jobs that have been horrific. I've been that I've been that busboy and that cooking in that server, and again, all these different jobs and worked at a grocery store one time that like, no offense to them, What I'm saying is it gets better. Like that's that goes along with don't quit like driving. 


But you know, anyways, segue. We're relevant to like the career that I do currently today. Yes, I've had jobs that have gone wrong, horribly wrong. Lots of mistakes, lots of things that have gone himself or didn't work out. But we've driven through it. And I guess, specifically to tell a story. This is a good one. So we got a we got a call to do a gig for H&M, which is a huge company, again, the clothing company, they had a campaign that they were doing worldwide, and they were doing it in Tokyo, they were doing it all over the planet. And basically what it was is that they wanted all these people to do kind of a mock protest. So that the ask was 300 extras, in basically black, crisp clothes with white crisp aprons with these protest signs. And they wanted a marching around the streets of San Francisco, with photography, like pictures being taken. And that all being uploaded to the internet real time. The tricky part was that we had 48 hours to do it. 


Interviewer 22:59
And why was this so short? 

Chris Cottingham 23:01
Well, because there was there was, unfortunately, a tragedy in New York. And they had planned to do it in New York as far as the US was concerned. But there was a tragedy in New York that had, they had to move it basically to another city. And we so we had 48 hours to put it all together. And we were in 48 hours, we were able to find the 300 extras, we were able to get all the aprons, we were able to make it all happen working through the night, you know, in the in the middle of the night in the studio and white aprons, you know, out to like make this thing happen. And last minute, putting this whole thing together and the permit fell through. So we needed basically a permit with the city to be able to do this and we weren't going to be able to do it otherwise. Now 48 hours, everything moved quick. So things were already go, money was already spent. Executives already flew from the East Coast and we're at their hotel in the city. And so we had to go in and basically with our head hung low and be the bearer of bad news that we weren't able to get the permit. 


Now, again, I think the lesson that I learned from all that was like, don't give up, right? Like keep driving for there's got to be a solution. And luckily they were they were they were kind of naive and level headed enough to be on the same page. Okay, what can we do? Well, somebody was able to get their cell phone number, you know, late at night made the call. And long story short, what we could do is we could break up that group of 300 into 10 groups of 30 and spread them throughout the city and basically make this happened. Well, now that means that we need more photographers, we need transportation for all these people. So like 12 hours to go like clock is ticking, maybe even eight. We got six buses, to trolleys, six more photographers, bike messengers to run the cards back to the to the HQ and coordinated all of this in Long story short, we were able to pull it off and it was a wonderful, wonderful gig and a good promotion and the client was happy and everybody was thrilled. But it's like you know things can go horribly, horribly wrong. And you know, as long as you keep driving through it and keep your keep a level head and positive attitude, they work out.


Interviewer 25:08  
Great, sorry. Stressful. Always have a backup plan. 


Chris Cottingham 25:09
Yeah, backup plan and like your peeps on call, right? Like to when you got got to call in that favor you know.


# MOTIVATIONAL ADVICE 
Interviewer 25:22
So our last question that we have for you is, what is a thought or a piece of advice you'd like to leave our listeners with?


Chris Cottingham 25:30  
Gosh, I feel like I've dropped so many knowledge bombs already. The piece of advice, again, it's like, don't get up, keep, or don't give up, keep driving all those other things, which is, it's interesting, because I listened to like a lot of motivational speakers. And I tried to, I tried to do that, again, for my own, like, kind of self help and like continuing to grow, right. And, you know, in that you're hearing a lot of the same things, you're hearing a lot of the same things. And it's hard to kind of imagine, you know, all of that being good advice that you can apply to your life. And it's really easy to say don't do 


Interviewer 26:05 
It sounds like a cliche 


Chris Cottingham 26:06
It does! It really, really does. But you know, it's like the one bit of advice that I have, I guess it's like, there have been so many times, I mean, this is my 11th business, right? So I've been through the roller coaster up and down, there's some that have been hugely successful that I sold made money, there's some that I've, you know, had to shut the doors and hand the keys over the landlord, right. So like, there's been a lot of businesses that I've ran. And through all that, like, there's been plenty of moments to where like, I saw the end, right, I saw the end or like things were good work or whatever. And for whatever reason, you know, it all worked out in every time good or bad or ugly that I've gone through those different things. It has opened up doors and opportunities to other things that I've been able to pursue, and I would not be where I am today, with not only my successes, but my failures, right? Each one of those have led me to the path that I am right now. And where I am now is I am living the dream, I get to do what I want to do for a living. And not only that, because what I wanted to do was like make music and be creative and do that all day every day. But now I get to share that with a bunch of other people that that have the same dream. And so it's like, you know, I've been able to grow 30, 40 times what I thought I would be able to do vicariously through them and what in the skills that I've been able to kind of pass down, pass down the chain. 


So it's like, yeah, don't give up and all those other things but like believe in what you're doing in be okay with the idea that you are going to fail. It's things that you set out to do the difference between somebody that's successful and somebody that's not are the people that get back up and dust themselves off, and keep pushing forward.
