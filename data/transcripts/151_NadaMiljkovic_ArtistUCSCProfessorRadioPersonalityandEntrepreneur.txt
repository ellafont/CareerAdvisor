# INTRODUCTION

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  0:00  
Hello and welcome to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Harte and you're listening to our show "What to be?" where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. "What to be?" is a program provided by "Your Future is our Business". A Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, panels and other work based learning activities. Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of Natural Bridges media, or Your Future is our Business. The information provided during this program does not reflect its career in its entirety. And today, I have the pleasure to speak to Nada Miljkovich, who is a multi disciplinarian. Hi Nada. 

Nada Miljkovic  0:43  
Hi, Patrick. 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  0:44  
Hey, thank you so much for taking the time to help us do this interview today. I really appreciate it. 

Nada Miljkovic  0:49  
Oh, it's totally my pleasure, Patrick. 

#CAREER JOURNEY 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  0:51  
Awesome. Now that you've done so much interesting work in your career so far. Do you mind briefly describing your career journey for us? 

Nada Miljkovic  0:58  
Oh, sure. My career journey started when my parents immigrated to the United States when I was three years old. And I started as being a Czech writer, basically a translator for my parents writing all of the stuff that they needed. And while I was growing up, my dad was finding different ways. He's an entrepreneur, just like my mom. And so they came already with that kind of entrepreneurial mindset. And they did all different kinds of things. They started different businesses, and were really successful, especially when you think about the fact that they didn't speak English. And, totally had a different coming from the former Yugoslavia, very different culture, communism. 

And so we came in my dad basically realized that he could make some money doing construction, and my sister was already a contract manager. So when I got to college, I wanted to do all kinds of stuff. And they were like, "No, you got to do something, you got to get to something that's going to make you some money". And so I got a Bachelors of Science in construction management, construction, engineering, technology, something like that from Purdue University, where I learned how to be a project manager. And also, though, because that wasn't enough for me, as far as my college experience. I also got a philosophy degree, a Bachelors of Arts and philosophy. And I also started taking a lot of different painting classes and design classes. And so when I graduated from Purdue, I came out to California, like a lot of people do. And Happy Halloween, everybody. I flew out here like a bat out of hell basically, and I'm so happy to be here. That was over 30 years ago.

 And I got out here and I started working in construction, I was a highway inspector. And then I was able to get in alignment kind of with my environmentalism. And I started building trains, train stations I built nine of the Bay Area Rapid Transit extension stations in the 90s. I worked with them from the very beginning, civil engineering all the way to systems integration. And then I realized, I guess it turned around 40, and my kids were starting to get older. And with the help of my husband, I was still working with a civil engineering company here in Santa Cruz. I ended up going back to school for my Master's in Fine Arts in the digital arts and new media program up at UCSC. I'd always been an artist. So as I was working in raising my kids, I was also starting to squeeze in whatever I could, and I started making movies. In fact, you saw one of my first feature length movies. 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  3:57  
Yeah, it was really, really cool.

Nada Miljkovic  3:58  
 Yeah, it's two villages, one heart. The documentary is basically out of this feeling that I have.  Let's say Allah, Margaret, Mead, that all the villages in the world are similar. So I ended up making a hour long documentary with some help from Sun. Sun up in Boulder Creek and a whole bunch of other people, it was a total community project. And with that, two villagers went hard about how Ben Lomond is very similar to my ancestral village in Serbia. Basically, it came down to a lot of Neo paganism and stewardship for nature exaltation. I ended up getting into the digital arts and new media program at UCSC. After that, when I graduated in 2009, I started a series of different small businesses: media, studio type businesses. The one that stuck was Artists on Art, which I'm still doing as a videographer. I also started teaching up at UCSC. I got this really amazing opportunity to teach radio and broadcast media. With that, I ended up meeting my champion, who is the provost of Crown College. The first time I met him he said "Hey Nada". I told him I wanted to teach full time. And he said, "Well, what would you like to teach? If you could do anything? What would you teach?" And I said, "I'd want to teach entrepreneurship, I feel like more than half of those students or at least half the students are going to end up working as freelancers and gig artists. We're not really training them for that. I mean, UCSC is an amazing school. It's an incredible research school. But as far as students knowing how to make invoices, proposals, and executing, I mean, they all know how to execute. It's the administrative part of of having a business, a small business. And he said, "That's exactly what I want to do!"

 And so with that, in 2016, we had our first entrepreneurship class, Crown 90. It's a startup academy.  A lot of students come with a business that they want to do. But that's not a requirement, you can join other people's teams. They learn how to do what we call the Lean Startup method, which is a method that came out of Stanford, with Steve Blank, who lives up in Pescadero. Where you do customer discovery, you find out if you have a market before you do anything. That's why it's the lean startup. So, we started Crown 90 and then we started thinking about social entrepreneurship, businesses for good, nonprofits. So then we created Crown 92. And then my latest class is Crown 95, which is called "Get Virtual".  This class was begun as a direct response to COVID with Toby Quarry. Toby is a local entrepreneur. I think he's the CEO or I'm not sure exactly, but he was working at cruise foam. He's an exec over at Cruise Foam where they're creating a natural based type styrofoam for packing. We have a terrible plastic problem as probably most of you know. And so, Cruise Foam is a Santa Cruz company started by Marco Rolandi, who is a electrical engineering professor up at UCSC.  They use some type of calcium, I think it's from  sea creatures. They're creating this foam that is disposable. 

So Toby calls me up and he says, "Hey Nada, I got this idea. There's all these businesses, the small businesses here in town, that are going to wither because of the social distancing protocols that were put in place for COVID." And he says, "I got this idea, these college students have these incredible digital skills. They're born into the digital world, very different from you and I and older folk. And so they have the skills that they could help these business owners to help them get online because as you know, a lot of the businesses here in town rely on tourism and people just walking into the stores. And many of these stores have been around for more than 30 years. And they've never had a website, they've never had a social media campaign. That's just not been a part of their needs, because they have walk in foot traffic into their brick and mortar stores. But with social distancing, that was put to a halt. And so, along with Bonnie Lipscomb from the City of Santa Cruz Economic Development, she gave us a couple businesses that she thought we could help. I grabbed my best entrepreneurship students and we together prototyped this class Crown 95, which we've been teaching every quarter since March of 2020. It's now become a part of UC wide. Anybody in the UC can take the class across campuses. 

We're also a part of the California Open College Program. So any student in a community college across California can take the class as well for free. People from Cabrillo college can take the class for free because we're in this program. And in this class, we basically teach the students about how to do interviewing, intake interviewing, write a proposal, get that proposal approved by their clients. The proposal has timelines, milestones.  Most of the work is either very low or no code, website building,  marketing campaigns, digital media, social media platforms, and that. We also make sure that our clients are able to use the websites after it.  Because we're using these low or no code, website platforms, it's very easy for my students to both pick it up themselves, and then teach somebody else how to do it. And so since then, we've launched over 100 clients, where we've completed their work. We've had over 150 students and volunteers working with us. We still have a large portion of the first students now become executives of Get virtual, they're co-founders of Get Virtual. And we have six other universities across the country that are using Get Virtual curriculum and program in their universities.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  11:35  
Well, congratulations on that. And in thank you so much, your career is very inspiring. For someone like me to who's gone back to school a little bit later in life, it's very inspiring to me that it can be done and that it's maybe never too old to start a new career.  To keep learning,  I think it's just a real privilege, right?

Nada Miljkovic  11:55  
Oh, I am a lifelong learner. In fact, I'm enrolled in a Ph.D. program right now at the University of Arts in Belgrade for digital arts. I've always wanted a PhD. I'm 55. I don't think it's too late to get my lifelong dream going.

# TYPICAL DAY/WEEK

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  12:13  
No, and listening to your story. It absolutely is not too late. So awesome. You do so much and you haven't really covered all of it. Can you just like briefly describe kind of what your typical day or week looks like?

Nada Miljkovic  12:28  
Well it's interesting you asked me that Patrick because when I was in my late 20s, I went through career counseling up at San Francisco. It was started by women for women but it's opened up since then. I don't remember exactly the name of the career counseling program. But while I was going through the career counseling, they told me "Nada, you know, you're a portfolio career kind of gal." And I was like, "what does that mean? I don't understand." She says, "you have so many interests, you have so many things that you want to do that having a 40 hour a week, one job is not going to make you happy, it's going to get you bored. And so you look like somebody that needs to have, let's say, Tuesdays and Thursdays you teach up at UCSC, teaching ethics right now and the Get Virtual class and then Mondays you do your nonprofit work" . I'm the chair of the board of the Arts Council of Santa Cruz County.  "Wednesdays you work on your digital art and your movies" for my PhD.  Oh, I'm now helping with the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship development actually up at UCSC.  Oh, and I also teach online, I teach to high school students all over the world, through international institutes, both at Stanford and some friends of mine who have started a new startup. And so I've really taken to heart what that career counseling setup for me because once I went through the career counseling and I got my actually got my job at BART, "I told them that I could only work 24 hours a week".  Those were my boundaries. That was how much time I could give for that. I also had small children So I had a lot of work there. And so, with that, I started really considering how to curate my life around my interests and and be able to make a living through doing basically my passions, the things that are most important to me. Okay.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  14:52  
And you know, you worked for the BART for roughly like 20 years, right.

Nada Miljkovic  14:56  
Well, actually, I worked for Caltrans as the highway inspector, I worked for BART. It was on and off.  I actually worked for the contractors a couple times, the construction work was really interesting. It was very easy for me because I grew up with my dad being a contractor. But first of all, I'm an environmentalist. And so, building a parking garage or a parking lot, where birds are nesting is very harmful for my heart. And so, I had to figure out a way where I could both be making money and be doing something that is positive for the environment. And so trains, obviously, to me is one of the best ways to do that.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  15:43  
Yeah. And as an artist, probably, maybe we're looking to express yourself more creatively?

Nada Miljkovic  15:48  
Oh, yeah, it's a little hard to express yourself creatively in construction. Although I'm not going to say you can't, especially if you're the type of person who believes that your life is your art. And so working as a contractor, I think you can do it. I've seen, I've seen backhoe operators that are artists that handle their equipment with grace and beauty. So I think you can do it, it was just hard for me.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  16:17  
Did you feel like maybe during that time that you were kind of like locked into that particular career? Maybe for like a lifetime? 

Nada Miljkovic  16:24  
No, because I really looked at how I could pull in different jobs while having this portfolio career. So understanding that I have many interests, and that for me to be satisfied as a person, I have to be doing a little bit of art and I have to be doing a little bit of project management. I have to be doing a little bit of radio. Right?

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  16:51  
Yeah. And you've been involved in radio for a couple of decades, right?

Nada Miljkovic  16:55  
Yes. I dabbled in it when I was at school at Purdue as an undergraduate. But then when I came out to California and lived in the Bay Area, I ended up working at KALX, I got two actual shows that I worked on there. One was called, I think it's still around, "Women hold up half the sky". And then the other one was called the "Women in the Arts". And it was a weekly show both of them. One was an hour long, and the other one was a half hour long. And I got trained at KALX and I was there for five years and loved it. 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  17:35  
Very cool. And you also co host a show here and I think you do another show on Wednesdays as well? 

Nada Miljkovic  17:40  
That's right. I co-host cutting edge so I get to hear you every week before when I get to co host with Linda Burnham Hall and Chris Benner. We bring stories of cutting edge Thinkers,  Doers, mostly from the university. And then on Wednesdays at three o'clock, I have a journalist roundtable called "Cruz News and Views" which is co hosted with Steve Palopoli, editor in chief at the "Good Times". He writes the show and helps me and then I do the engineering here in the station. 

# FAVORITE PROJECTS

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  18:15  
Okay, cool. Thank you for sharing that. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the what to be show on KSQD Santa Cruz 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Harte and I'm speaking with Nada Miljkovic. Nada, you've done so much over your career so far like a lot of really cool work and interesting projects. Do you mind briefly, talking to us about some of your more favorite projects that you've worked on? Or are currently working on?

Nada Miljkovic  18:41  
Well, I have had an incredibly privileged career. One of the things that I got to do was in this Stanford international institutes, where they sent me into the world to teach high school kids. And what I was teaching them was entrepreneurship, the simulation class, the Crown 90 that I was telling you about. Basically, I would teach the kids to brainstorm an idea formed teams around them, and then do customer discovery, interview people, gather qualitative data, analyze that data, and then apply that to their business model to see if they had the right assumptions. So you start with "I think this is what's the business should look like. I think this is what the value propositions are. These are what the customer discovery, customer segments, I think this is what my customer relationships should be like, my revenue stream, my key resources, key partners, key activities, and, of course, at the end, how much all of it costs". And through the process, you're asking people if they think you have a good idea. I also introduce them to experts in the fields from whatever they're pursuing, and then also help them find mentors. These classes are usually two or three weeks long. And so I've have gotten to go to Chile and Peru and Colombia and Brazil and Mexico and Kazakhstan doing this. 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  20:13  
That's so cool. And do you want to talk about maybe just some of the more stressful parts of some of the different things that you've done throughout your career?

Nada Miljkovic  20:23  
Well, I think, being a small business owner can be very stressful. I teach entrepreneurship. And part of that is teaching what is the entrepreneurial mindset. What makes an entrepreneur work and be successful? And it's risk takers.  You are taking a risk when you're starting your own business. You're, sometimes working seven days a week, all the time to keep your business going to figure out your your cash flow and revenue streams and hustle for your next project. Right? And so you're, you're executing, while also hustling for that next gig. So being a small business owner is very stressful. But it's also incredibly liberating and freeing, because you do what you want to do when you want to do it.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  21:22  
Yeah, I can imagine that with the uncertainty with taking those risks when things do work out, it must feel really amazing knowing that it worked out because of everything that you did. 

Nada Miljkovic  21:34  
Yeah. But some of the hardest parts have been trying to start businesses with other people. I tell my students, "when you do that kind of thing, you're in some ways marrying this person". And so you have to be really careful who you want to partner with. In a small business. 

# OTHER JOBS/ROLES

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  21:52  
Okay. And you have another company. You mentioned it. Artists on Art? It's a Media Company? 

Nada Miljkovic  21:58  
Yeah, it's an LLC. It's been around since 2011. I help people with their stories. Sometimes the stories need a business plan. Sometimes those stories need websites, sometimes they need movies. Sometimes they just need tutoring, I've really been very open with the services that I provide. But I'm very choosy as to who I work with. They have to be doing something that's helping the world. I don't want to waste my time working on something that's not going to make the world a better place. The world needs us to do this.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  22:43  
Yeah, absolutely. And what is the Earth Lab in San Francisco that you work with?

Nada Miljkovic  22:47  
The Earth Lab is a new nonprofit that I am the president of the board with it. The executive directors are ELIZABETH STEVENS and Annie Sprinkle. These are Santa Cruz Mountain residents. ELIZABETH STEVENS is an art professor at UCSC. And she and her partner Annie sprinkle who is a sexologist. They're both performance artists, they're incredible artists.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  23:20  
Did you have them on the Cutting Edge show? 

Nada Miljkovic  23:22  
Yes we did. Did you hear the show?

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  23:24  
 I did. It was very interesting.

Nada Miljkovic  23:25  
So yeah, they're pushing this idea: eco sexuality. They want to bring fun and joy to environmentalism so that more people could be  fighting for our earth. The main idea is that we treat the earth like a lover, as opposed to treating the earth like a mother. And what I mean by that is that we tend to take from our moms, our moms are there to provide, to serve, to support us, right? Which is kind of how we've been dealing with the earth. But if we just switch the paradigm a little bit and think about "how do I treat the earth like a lover?" Like, when you have a lover, you want you want your lover to be happy, you want your lover to be thriving, right? You want them to be happy. And so if we can think about treating the earth like that, maybe we won't be doing some of the harm that we're doing.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  24:33  
Yeah, I agree. That's really great stuff. And do you want to talk about why the work that you do is important to yourself personally and or to society?

Nada Miljkovic  24:42  
Well, like I was saying, I feel like the Earth is in need of champions. And I'm not just an environmentalist, I'm also a social justice activist. I actually call myself an artivist. I use my art practice as my activism, and so with my environmentalism and my social justice activism, I really want to do as much as I can to both help people and help the earth , all living creatures.  And that's what I was saying about being choosy with who my cut my clients are. If my clients aren't in alignment with doing something that's going to make the world a better place in some way, not just taking, but actually giving back more, then I'm happy to help.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  25:41  
Yeah, that's beautiful. Thank you for sharing that. And, you know, for students listening, what kind of person do you think would enjoy this line of work? You know, I guess, in what you're doing currently.

Nada Miljkovic  25:51  
So, being an instructor is really hard. Especially being a lecturer at a university, especially post COVID. Educators across the country, across the world, are not feeling supported. They're burning out. And we don't have enough teachers. 

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  26:13  
Yeah. And you know, when I read a lot of articles about how everything has been affecting the students, but I don't feel like I'm reading enough articles on how much it's affecting the teachers, too, because their workload has increased a lot with the online learning. Is that correct?

Nada Miljkovic  26:27  
Well, the online learning, we're back in the classroom, but everyone's wearing masks, it's so hard to understand the students while they're wearing masks. I get a microphone and I share the microphone, but still,  having a discussion, having real dialogue is just hard. But it's not impossible. And I think what's really most important, if I was going to give students that are listening advice, is to really get to know yourself, do self exploration, find out what are your values? What are the things that you're really good at? What are your strengths? What are your most important values and strengths? And find a way to use those together

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  27:21  
Yeah, that's great. Thank you for that. Nada, what advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career in the line of work being an instructor or maybe some of the other things that you've done?

Nada Miljkovic  27:34  
Well, they're more than welcome to email me at nada@ucsc.edu. That's nada@ucsc.edu. And I'd be happy to help navigate the classes that I'm giving those that are open to all college students, and then the classes that are open to UCSC students and to UC wide students.

# ADVICE TO LISTENERS

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  27:56  
Okay, thank you. And what about advice for someone who is unsure about their career path?

Nada Miljkovic  28:02  
Then I think you should just try it all. See, if you like it, give it a whirl. I think there's a lot of jobs right now that people could give it a try with. Talk to people in positions that you want to, perhaps, experiment with. Find people that are really happy and in their jobs, and ask them about them. Talk to people, people love to talk about their jobs. 

# CONCLUSION

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  28:33  
They do. And Nada, I just want to thank you so much for taking the time to join and do this interview today. You shared so much great knowledge with us. And I'm sure you're inspiring me and I'm sure that you're inspiring others as well. 

Nada Miljkovic  28:45  
Patrick, it's been my pleasure.

Interviewer (Patrick Harte)  28:47  
Thank you very much.
