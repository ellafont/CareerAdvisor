 What is a chief operations officer, really?


Aki Williams  2:02  
Chief Operations Officer manages the overall picture day to day operations of an organization, making sure that staff has what they need nothing's in their way to be able to provide their best work for the day. It's also making sure that the client relations and the client experience student experience at defib is the best it can possibly be. And making sure that both of those sides the client facing and the employee facing are all working in a way that's going to keep the organization moving in a forward direction.

And can you give us an example of what a dangerous looks like?


Aki Williams  2:41  
Well, a day of mine would start probably about 4:45. In the morning, I exercise, I really feel it's super important to have that exercise. It's like hygiene, it's brushing your teeth. And it really keeps that focus going it gives me almost a meditation time where I can think about what's going to go on in my day, I come out of the gym or off my bike and write down my top five goals for the day shower, and then I hit the office or hit work before everyone else gets there, I get a chance to get a lay of the land. So that starts around 730 or eight. And my day will go probably until about 745 at night, eight o'clock before. I'm winding it down and starting to roll back and just be a person again as opposed to the CEO, the CEO, the DJ DJ on the ones and twos making sure that everything's spinning right as far as our business goes and our clients and employees.

# EARLY CAREER 


Interviewer  5:05  
How did you get into this industry?


Aki Williams  5:08  
So, I started very young in this industry, I was actually working as a nursing assistant at the age of 15. And a nursing home, I wanted to do that I wanted to go into medicine, originally, I planned on going into medicine to become a physician. And at the time, I didn't really have a lot of resources financially. And I didn't have the support, or really anyone that was in my, as far as adults in my life that had any medical experience. So with that, I was seeking out opportunities to get in there, the healthcare environment, I saw an ad at my high school for the regional occupation program. 


So I attended the regional occupation program for the Certified Nursing Assistant course. And I was a little sneaky, you had to be 16 years old to graduate from the program. And I went in at 15. And when they said, is anyone not 16? Raise your hand, I just pretended like I didn't hear them. The graduation date for the program was actually on my 16th birthday. So I just slid under the radar the whole time. 


And the first opportunity I had as a job shadowing and job experience was at a nursing home during this training, where they offered me a job. So I went with my work permit to the high school and they said, We've never had anybody do this before. And let me be the first. So just to campaign to get access to people. It's really funny because the time I was trying to decide, like need to make money because I want to go to medical school, what's going to pay best and it was two different jobs. There's Wayne's beauty college at the time, which was also right by Santa Cruz high that had the regional occupation program. And I went in there and you had to be 18 Oh, so you could be I thought I've always thought that was kind of funny. You can take care of human beings. At the age of 15, you're considered mature enough to take care of people that are sick or having end of life care, which is such an intimate experience or you can cut dye hair, but you have to be 18. You're not mature enough to do that. But you can take care of you know, sick and dying people. And it always kind of tickled me. Of course, being a cosmetologist is very intimate as well. And it requires a lot of personal responsibility. And I'm certainly not knocking it. I just thought, well, that's weird. It did help me come to the decision that I would be going to the CNA program for a Hopi as opposed to waiting, I was very anxious to get rolling.


 So I did start as a nursing assistant, I went on to use the ROP program, again to get my EMT. And then so it was emerging Emergency Medical Technician. And then I got a job as a patient care tech after that. So it was working in the hospital, a local hospital that I was working at was very supportive in cross training a number of the patient care technicians. So I got experience working doing EKGs working as an EKG tech working as a unit secretary in the hospital and also working as a phlebotomist in the lab drawing blood. So to me, it really opened up all of these doors in the hospital and opened up a lot of opportunities to find mentors to really kind of guide me throughout my career. 


# SKILLS


Interviewer  8:19  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to what to be ks QD 90.7 FM. I'm Melina. And I'm joined by other hosts, Nick. And we're speaking with Aki Williams, who is the Chief Operations Officer and co owner of Defense's?


What are some of the skills and qualities that you would say are most important for the things that you wanted to do? Like the certain jobs you've had and some things you've picked up?


Aki Williams  8:42  
I'd say tenacity is really important. There's a lot of people who will tell you, you can't or you need to wait, or what's your hurry. And as a kid, I think that was probably the most frustrating thing I would hear I was I really felt I was on this fast track towards a career. I knew what I wanted to do. And many times a lot of my friends parents would say, Well, what's your hurry? Why don't you just be a kid right now? Why are you so focused on getting a career and when you know what you want to do for the rest of your life? You want the rest of your life to start right away? Yeah. And so I would tell them that and they'd say, you just need to take time to be a kid and go to a four year college and just kick around and find out what you want. And I said I don't need to do that. So we're going to No, I really felt like that did it was a kind of a demotivator if you're not tenacious and you don't keep your eyes on what you want to do. 


From where I was working in the hospital as a patient care tech. I went on to become a registered nurse. And after that, I started working in intensive care units and cardiac catheterization labs working on patients who'd had heart attacks, putting in pacemakers with cardiologists and then moving on to work in a pediatric ICU and neonatal ICU. You and neurosurgical ICU and then kind of culminating with my career working as an advanced practice flight nurse as an aeromedical flight nurse. So working on trauma patients and ICU, if I had fell into that mindset of I need to wait for someone to tap me on the shoulder and give me permission to seek out opportunities, I would have been waiting for someone to knock on my door and say, Okay, it's, you're allowed to go want this now, because X amount of time has passed. So I'd say tenacity is probably the most important to go back to your question. Sorry, I went off on a bit of a tangent there. 


The other thing I would say is that, in addition to the tenacity, you have to have that internal humility, where you're really ready to have your butt handed to you sometimes and really go into that uncomfortable place, we're always afraid of failing. And that's why practice is so important practice where you're doing that thing that you just can't nail it, whether it's trying to take a blood pressure, or trying to start IVs, or whatever it might be, to be willing to say, I am not good at this, and I want to be better. And really leave yourself open to have that kind of not necessarily criticism, or if it is constructive criticism, if you will, where people tell you if you want to get better at this, you need to do A, B and C nobody really learns anything from great job. It's great to hear it, it makes you feel good on the way home. And by no means do I think, you know, people should only hear the negative, but really leaving yourself open to have that feedback. Even if you don't agree you can always say thanks for the feedback, and then mull it over anytime I've said that with a kind of a lump in my throat on the way home. By the time I hit my front door, I was convinced I need to take on this new skill or I need to listen to that feedback. It only hurts if it's true, right? 


# NURSING


Interviewer  11:54  
Yeah. And what are been some of your favorite areas of nursing?


Aki Williams  11:57  
The areas of nursing that I found the most enjoyment out of, I would say are the ones that terrified me the most when I was in school, and I had to take care of a pediatric patient or a patient with neuro which neurologic issues seem to be this mystery wrapped in an enigma tucked into a box of tsunamis. And it always seemed so intimidating. And neurologists were so intelligent, but not great communicators. So it always felt like a big mystery to me. And when I was first out of school, and I was still kind of in that student mode and feeling like everything is new. That's when I had the opportunity to jump in to neurosurgical ICU. So I said yes, please. 


Interviewer  12:45  
And was half in the you didn't feel like 100% ready for it. You went in and did anyways right? 


Aki Williams  12:50  
I did, I wanted to go to that uncomfortable place that uncomfortable place whenever I'm in that that spot personally between I want to and and need to that that place where do you want to quit? Or do you need to quit that? That uncomfortable area is where I've done the most personal and professional growth. Additionally, because I was brand new, as a nurse and brand new in an ICU, the opportunity goes somewhere else, everyone knew I was brand new, and everyone knew I was ready for more information. So I had a lot more guardian angels, if you will, as colleagues and a lot more mentors and people that were willing to watch me and make sure I didn't do anything stupid. And a lot of people I could ask stupid questions, too. So it really made for a much better learning experience as opposed to going in. 


Interviewer  13:43  
And like assuming that you have experience with them, you don't learn anything.


Aki Williams  13:46  
Exactly, exactly. And plus, you know, those kinds of things that we put on a shelf, whether it's as soon as I get X amount of experience, or I just need to work on this kind of unit that I have no interest in whatsoever to get my experience, then I'll go to the area I want doesn't serve anybody, it doesn't serve the patients, it doesn't serve the professional, it doesn't serve the colleagues because you're not doing that then you really are, you know, get out of bed for every day. And the longer you keep something on a shelf, you know, what happens to things on a shelf that gets dusty, right? So I don't like to put those things on the shelf that scare me, I want to turn them into merit badges as quickly as I can rip off the band aid and go.


Interviewer  14:30  
If you were to hire someone to replace you, what would you look for in a candidate?


Aki Williams  14:35  
I would look for someone who's tenacious, I would look for someone who who thinks instead of no who thinks next, how else can I get there? Can I go over them around them under them through them? How will I get this goal achieved? And I'm looking for someone who would be compass oriented as opposed to map oriented. So if I were to say for instance, I want you to get Get to Los Gatos. Instead of saying, Here's a map to Los Gatos, I'd say, there's Los Gatos and appoint off to it, and you would use a compass and you would find a way to get there, it might be better than what's on the map, I'm looking for someone to blaze a trail and tell me why that's a better idea, and bring new information and pull me out of my comfort zone and make me look at things through different eyes. Those are the kinds of people that I want replacing me and making my company better. And that those were the kinds of nurses that I would train in the field when I was working in the ICU or the emergency department people that were looking at new things and challenged me ask me questions that made me think and made me go back to my reference books or online and do that research make me better while I teach you? Because at the end, it's all about me, right?


# DAY TO DAY


Interviewer  15:50  
So what are some of the things that have kept you going so on a day to day now?


Aki Williams  15:53  
The things that keep me going are my family and my commitment to the community, which sounds like I'm in a beauty pageant or something. I don't mean it. Nothing wrong with beauty pageants. But in my mind, I think I have a commitment to the community of things that I want to provide a one to provide the best EMS education in the county and the surrounding counties and want to create a paramedic program. I want the young nurses and the third and fourth semester nurses that come to us and want that extra level of training, I want everybody to leave defib with a sense of confidence and to have learn one new thing that they didn't think they were going to learn. Resuscitation can be such a intimidating, angry gauntlet of emotions. And I really want people to walk in to classes about resuscitation or into the next resuscitation that they have where someone is actively dying, or maybe they have died. And they're working on that team. to resuscitate people, I want them to have been in that uncomfortable space, where they have that self doubt. And they have those moments where they pause and don't trust their muscle memory to do the things that they do know how to do. I want them to have those experiences at defib. So when they go to the real deal, they've been through this, it's not their first rodeo, they have that confidence and they leave feeling like they contributed because they did when we're resuscitating people, they're already dead. That's why we resuscitate them, you can't hurt someone who's dead. You can only make it better. And really, there's nowhere to go but up. And I want people to feel empowered when they leave defib the other motivation and I'd say the thing that really makes me go is is my family, my husband, my daughter is grown and is doing her thing and in her career, which is great and my son is going into the Navy, but I want to give them that drive. I want them to be proud. And so at the end of the day, I always want to go to bed proud of what I contributed to our company, to our friends, family, and to our community.


Interviewer  18:00  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to want to be at ks QD 90.7. FM Santa Cruz. I'm Alina and I'm joined by other hosts, Nick are speaking with Aki Williams and learning about her career journey to become the chief operations officer and co owner of defib. 


This what's the difference between an EMT and a paramedic?


Aki Williams  18:18  
That's a great question. And it's something that confounds the general public, for the most part, to the detriment of both of those specialties. So an emergency medical technician is the entry level for EMS. Actually, the entry level would be Emergency Medical Responder, but they don't write on ambulances. I can tell you that a paramedic and an EMT, neither one of them is a quote unquote ambulance driver. So I'm going to put that out there for the general public that is incredibly derogatory. It's the equivalent of calling a nurse, a waitress or a flight attendant as stewardess or handmade or it's very derogatory in the community. So when people refer to paramedics and emergency medical technicians, as ambulance drivers, I die a little inside when I hear it and go to the point of being rather obnoxious when I tried to very diplomatically re educate people in the line at the grocery store or in the mall when I hear someone say it to me it's a it's a passion issue. 


So the difference between EMT and paramedic would be the same as a nursing assistant and a registered nurse. So an EMT resuscitates people, they do basic life support skills, which is really the most important thing we always say. An excellent paramedic is a good EMT, you have to have a good paramedic is an excellent EMT, you want to have those basic skills, everyone should have them. Paramedics do advanced life support, so they start IVs. They do advanced airway management. They administer medications, and they read EKG rhythms. So So those would be the big things that I think the general public would understand. EMTs do basic life support, so they do resuscitation. CPR, of course they do some things like an epi pen, they'll administer that or glucose. If someone is diabetic and they'll check finger sticks, blood sugars, they're all trained in stopping the bleed, things like that. hemorrhage control broken bones, but as far as the advanced skills that goes to Paramedicine, they both have the initial EMT but a paramedic is an EMT dash p. So Emergency Medical Technician Dashi is a paramedic, mostly ambulances run a paramedic and EMT in our county now it used to be two paramedics and a BLS ambulance where they're transporting someone maybe from a dialysis center back to a care facility or from somewhere like sunshine Villa to go have dialysis or to a wound care center that would be run by two EMTs. And that's a BLS transport unit.


Interviewer  20:59  
Do you remember your first time resuscitating someone?


Aki Williams  21:02  
I do, I do a lot of resuscitation is are super memorable for me. But the very first resuscitation, I just remember this person saying that they didn't feel good. And then watching their face go blank. And I was by myself. And so I was in the hospital area. And I put on the emergency light and started doing CPR on this person and we actually did resuscitate them. And for the rest of the day, I don't know if my feet touched the ground. It was the most amazing adrenaline rush I've ever had. And I talked really loud, like I had just come out of a rock concert. When I left. Super everything I did was super hyper animated and loud. But at that moment, when I was doing the CPR, everything slowed down. It was kind of like being in the matrix where, you know, you just look around, you're like this is exactly what I'm supposed to be doing right now. I was born to do this. There's certain moments in life where you have like, everything falls together and you think there's a reason I'm here. I'm absolutely supposed to be doing this. This is my thing.


# STORIES


Interviewer  22:14  
Do you have any interesting stories that you wanted to share with us?


Aki Williams  22:18  
There's a myriad of stories that come along with a career in EMS and nursing. At a hospital in South County, I had a patient that had taken care of in the emergency department that was walking his dog and separated his shoulder. And when he came in, we treated him for a separated shoulder. He had no history, medications or allergies. He had never seen a doctor, he was 52 years old and super fit guy. We told him, Hey, you know you're at that age where you need to have a colonoscopy, you should get a physical, you should have those other things. And so I was working another day when I wasn't in the emergency department in the GI lab where they were doing colonoscopies and he happened to be my patient, and we found a precancerous area in his colon, they were able to remove it, he did really well. And he came in later on and said You saved my life twice in one day. And I said, you know, the separated shoulder, I really he said You saved my dog's life because you said don't be mad at the dog. He was running his dog on the beach and the leash came out and and tripped him. So he landed on his shoulder. I said, I think I saved your dog's life the first time and the second time. I just told you to get a scope man. But it worked. So colonoscopy save lives, just like resuscitation does.


Interviewer  23:32  
And I have another question. 


Aki Williams 23:33
Absolutely. 


Interview 23:34
What is the hardest part of your job?


Aki Williams  23:36  
There's a couple of things. One of those things is compassion, burnout. I see it with a lot of my colleagues and I know I had suffered from it before where you have people that are constantly needing and there's a lot of psych social stuff that gets intertwined and chemical dependency and people who don't have the resources they need, so they have to kind of maneuver and when you're in the emergency department, you're really the receptacle for all of the woes of our community, whether it be drug abuse, or mental illness, or people that just aren't getting what they need. And so they're they hit the door angry, and you just feel that all the time. And to be able to step back and know it's not about you and it's not personal, they're just working through what they need to work through is something that kind of will keep you going. I'd say the other part is because we're in such a world of Yelp, and a world of you know, give me what I want as opposed to what I need. It's really can be difficult when you're trying to give somebody information that is science based and it doesn't fit their paradigm or their preconceived notions, and it turns into a customer service issue. That can also happen with families. So you'll have patients in the intensive care unit that have orders where they don't want to be resuscitated and they're very old. and very broken and very ill and they'll never come off of machinery. But the family will sometimes hold that up because of their own dynamics feeling like that in the ICU where I felt I would turn my patients and take care of them. And I always assumed they could hear me when I would say, I hope you know, I'm I'm doing this because I have to I'm sorry that you're in this position. That was always very hard for me, because we weren't following what the patient wanted. We were following what their family wanted. And that always felt like a paradox to being patient centered. 


Interviewer  25:36  
Yeah. What is the most rewarding part of your job?


Aki Williams  25:39  
Just feeling like you've made a difference. And it's not like the big things, it's the little wins before I go to bed every night, I think of like three wins that I've had for the day. And those little wins really float you on days when you just feel like I don't know if you guys have seen the little mermaid movie years ago, all those little mermaids that lost the bat with Ursula, the sea, which then turned in like those little seaweed things. They look so forlorn, and they kind of just swayed back and forth, and they looked so broken, there's days where you feel like that little secret thing. The things that kept me going, were having those moments where I would get a call when I was working in the emergency department, and they'd call me into another unit and say, My grandmother is asking for Aki to come or the blue haired nurse and start her IV, she's really hard stick, she's getting some blood transfusion and she's been poked 1000 times and going in there and getting that and having the family have that look of elation and relief on their face. To me, that's, that's 20 wins, right? Or those moments where you have the guy who comes in and separates his shoulder and you say, Go get a colonoscopy, dude, at least check under the hood. And he goes in and gets it done, and comes back with it, something that he dodged a bullet. Those are all wins, and, and the moments where you can make the shot hurt less, or the moments where you are able to help someone, whether it's a patient or a colleague, because we have to really take care of each other. Those are the things that feel my tank throughout the day.


Interviewer  27:10  
And the last question that we have for you, is there anything else that you'd like to share with us?


Aki Williams  27:15  
Well, we do have something that I'm really proud of the regional occupation program, which is now career technical education really helped me as a kid with limited resources. And by resources, let's just be real limited money, had no dough, my parents had no dough. It was essentially a emancipated minor kind of trying to make my own way. I've received so much love and support from the county office of education because of regional occupation that I wanted to give back. So defib, this is now going to be offering a scholarship through your future is our business for EMT training. And it's one of those things where as a kid, you always think like, How can I repay you? And the ability to be able to do this, it makes me feel like I'm going to find that young Aki out there, or a kid who wants to do what I did. And this is their first step. And whenever people tell me one day, I say make this day one, but one day, so I want to help find that person who is looking for their day one. So that's something that we're pretty excited about is I'm hoping we find that person who is going to be a fit, and it's going to help change their life the way the education in Santa Cruz did for me.
