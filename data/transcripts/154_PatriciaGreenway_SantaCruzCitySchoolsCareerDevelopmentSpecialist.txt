#CAREER JOURNEY WITH PATRICIA GREENWAY, FROM INTERIOR DESIGN TO NURSING TO BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.




Patrick Hart  0:14  
Hello and welcome everyone to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and you're listening to our show what to be where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What to be is a program provided by "your futures our business" at Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos panels and other work based learning activities. Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of natural bridges, media, or your future is our business. The information provided during this program does not reflect his career in its entirety. And today, I have the pleasure to speak to Patricia Greenway, who is on the board of directors and president of access to employment, career development and specialist with Santa Cruz city schools, and who is also on the board of directors for the Santa Cruz Symphony league. I hope I got that right. Hi, Patricia. Hi. Hi, how are you? I'm good. Thanks. Thank you. And thank you very much for taking the time to help do the interview today. Really appreciate it.




Patricia Greenway  1:17  
Yeah, I'm happy to do it.




Patrick Hart  1:18  
Cool. Thank you. Patricia. Do you mind briefly describing your career journey for us?




Patricia Greenway  1:24  
I'll see you while I was in high school, I was mainly focused on going to the Art Institute of Chicago to be an interior designer. I've done a lot of research on interior design schools. And at that time, the Art Institute in Chicago was one of the best in the nation. My senior year in high school, I had the opportunity to do a regional occupational program class that was focused on interior design. And I discovered that interior design was a math based career. So I immediately backpedaled and decided I did not want to do interior design. Because I did not want to do math all day, every day. My father talked to me a lot about nursing school and encouraged me to enroll in nursing school because he said it's a good paying job. And it's a job that I could have security and I could go anywhere in the world and have a job and I would never be out of a job. And those were very, you know, valid points. So I enrolled in surgical nursing school. And I did one semester and I was fascinated with anatomy and medical terminology. But I really didn't like the fact that I was not going to have a creative outlet. I'm a very social person, a very creative person. So after that first semester, I kind of reassessed myself and discovered that I was really interested in business administration and marketing. So I ended up going to school for that. And that's kind of the career path that I followed. But as I tell a lot of my students, it's okay to make career changes in your lifetime. Because sometimes you get into a college program or career training program, or you get into a career itself, and you discover that it's not what you thought it was going to be, and you don't feel that it's going to make you happy. So I can attest that that happens many times to people in their life.




Patrick Hart  3:11  
Yeah, thank you for sharing that. And so do you just want to tell us kind of what you do with the with access to employment.




#JOB PREPARATION, EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS, AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT.




Patricia Greenway  3:19  
So I joined access to employment about four years ago as a youth employment specialist. And I would facilitate different workshops throughout Santa Cruz County at different schools and libraries and the Santa Cruz teen center on different employment preparation topics, resumes and cover letters, interview skills, workplace safety, workplace communication. And it ended up that I started a youth employment program at Costanoa High School. And the principal emailed me one summer and said, you know, hey, there's a job opening as a career development specialist with Santa Cruz city schools. And it's essentially what you're doing for us for free, you should apply for the job so that you can get paid for what you're doing. And I applied for the job. And I was working with Consuelo horas, who is a career development specialist in the transition programs for Santa Cruz city schools. And at the time, she was president of access to employment and she encouraged me to join the board of directors for access to employment as a youth employment specialist. And I joined and served on the board for a couple of years as a youth employment specialist and Consuelo ended up resigning from the board. She retired from the board and I was voted in as the new president. So it was it was a little exciting, but also a little. It wasn't something I anticipated doing. I wasn't planning to take on the role of president but I have such a phenomenal team with the access to employment board members that it's been such an easy transition for me to move into the president. See, I really commend the team for everything that they do to go out in the community and help coordinate one of Santa Cruz County's largest annual job fairs that's been happening since 1991. Our board of directors, you know, we're a volunteer based organization. So our, our board of directors, you know, works very hard, and they do it for free. And they make the huge difference in our community, for a lot of people that are struggling, we specialize in people with disabilities, people with criminal records, youth, and then seniors who are looking to get back into the workforce. So we were out there kind of helping the underdog, get back into the workforce and make sure that they have, you know, a good job, and that they're working at companies that treat them fairly. Well,




Patrick Hart  5:51  
I just love that. I think it's what you guys are doing is so great. And then congratulations on becoming the president to that. Thank you. That's awesome. And yeah, and you just want to tell us kind of like what your main duties and responsibilities are?




Patricia Greenway  6:06  
Well, for access to employment as President, I facilitate and oversee our agenda and our board meetings every month, I work closely with our treasurer to keep a close eye on our budget and our financial reports to make sure that our you know, our exhibitors have have paid their dues for our job fair, and to make sure that our money is being spent wisely. And we're helping support programs in the community that align with what our mission is, I also work closely with the marketing coordinator to kind of help promote our event. And I also work closely with our logistics coordinator to kind of, you know, do outreach with the local employers to see who's planning to come to our event and make sure that they have a good location as an exhibitor at our event. And we we have a, we have a great team, we all get along really well together. And we, we all have different connections in the community. So it's nice to have such a wide variety of different talents on our team that can really kind of spread out throughout Santa Cruz County and have a vast reach with employers and job seekers in the community. Okay,




Patrick Hart  7:18  
and you were sharing that you are working with a pretty wide range of age groups of people, right? Yes,




Patricia Greenway  7:25  
yes, we, you know, you have to be 14 to get a work permit. So we work with, you know, 14 up to the age of 100. Anyone that that wants to to work is is welcome in our job fair.




Patrick Hart  7:37  
That's really awesome. And, you know, you told me before that you kind of floated around between different schools, but now that you've settled at Soquel High School in the past, did you say a year or so?




Patricia Greenway  7:49  
Yes. Just since August, yes. Okay. Nice. And that's, that's actually through Santa Cruz City Schools. I'm a Career Development Specialist in the special education department for Santa Cruz city schools.




Patrick Hart  8:01  
Okay, so that's a different job.




Patricia Greenway  8:02  
That's it? Yes. That's a paid job.




Patrick Hart  8:06  
Nice. Do you want to tell us more about that? Yes. So




Patricia Greenway  8:09  
I got involved with this. I was volunteering in the community doing youth employment workshops. And I had started a student employment program at Costanoa High School, helping students find jobs and draft resumes and develop interviewing skills. And the principal contacted me and said the part time career development specialist position had opened with Santa Cruz city schools, and he encouraged me to apply. He said, You're doing this for free for us. And you've been doing it for a while, and you're really making a difference. And it would be great if you could be in the community at other schools, helping more students and be paid for what you're doing. So I applied for the position. And I was hired. And it's been great because I've really expanded my knowledge of career training programs that are available and other resources for special ed students in our community with helping them during high school and then after high school with developing independent living skills and getting into college and getting enrolled in vocational training. And it's just been so great to work with the Special Education team at Santa Cruz city schools and just learn from them and, you know, be able to work with more students because of their willingness to hire me and let me be a career development specialist for them. Yeah,




Patrick Hart  9:29  
that's so beautiful. And it sounds like the jobs help each other out, right? Yes.




Patricia Greenway  9:34  
Yep. Okay. Yeah, it's, it's nice to be on the board of directors for access to employment and also be with Santa Cruz city schools because it helps me kind of reach a broad range of employers. Through both positions. I can work with exhibitors from the access to employment job fair to help students get jobs and through the work that I do with Santa Cruz city schools, I can and sometimes convert those employers into being an exhibitor at the access to employment job fair and help them kind of spread their wings and reach more job seekers in the community beyond the students that I work with. Yeah,




Patrick Hart  10:12  
that is so awesome. And if that wasn't enough, you're also on the board of directors and I think you do marketing. Is that right? For the Santa Cruz Symphony League? Yes. Okay. Do you want to talk about how long? How long have you been doing that? And what's that look like?




#SANTA CRUZ SYMPHONY LEAGUE'S MUSIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND FUNDRAISING EVENTS.




Patricia Greenway  10:27  
I've been doing that for almost three years, something music is something I've always had a huge appreciation for. I love all genres of music, bluegrass, classical, I listened to rap and hip hop, I listened to languages, I listened to music and languages that I don't actually understand. But to me, music is such a universal language. You can just feel you know what the musician is playing or hear what the singer is singing and it brings out emotion and feelings that I just find fascinating. I got involved with the symphony League, I had been to a number of their events. I've been a season ticket holder with the Santa Cruz Symphony for eight years, nine years now, I believe. And shout out to Maestro Daniel Stewart. He's phenomenal. He's doing wonderful things with the Santa Cruz symphony. And I just have such love and appreciation for everything that he brings to the symphony and the community. But I wanted to get more involved outside of just being a season ticket holder with going to the concerts. And going to the fundraiser events, I've really wanted to help support the music education programs that the Santa Cruz Symphony does because they go into schools throughout Santa Cruz County and they work with the youth in our community and they really get them involved with music. And it's so nice to have that in the classroom. And I wanted to help fly you know, just raise money for that and and support that, that effort. And it's been so great working with the symphony staff and the Santa Cruz Symphony league volunteers and board members because they do such wonderful things in our community, not only with music, but just with a social event, you know, kind of mindset that they have. They have so many fun events that are just so exciting. You know, we go to the Laguna Siena Laguna Seca track, and we do these track tours. And we have lunch and I take my Porsche out there. And I'm able to, you know, just get out there and kind of let loose and it's really fun. But I'm also helping, like raise money for music education and the Santa Cruz symphony. They also do their annual gala, which is a lot of fun. You also, they always have these great bands at the gala and people dance. And it's just such a fun event. And the food is always wonderful. And it's always such a fun place to be because everyone's having a great time and just, you know, kind of there to fulfill, you know, the goal of raising money for the symphony and helping support music, education and the community. And then they also have the annual Home Tour, which is coming up this weekend. For those of you that are not familiar with the the symphony link Home Tour, it's happening November 20, and 21st. And we're gonna do the shops at the home tour at the Capitola community center. And then the home tour is going to go on for the month of November through December. So get your tickets online at Santa Cruz Symphony League website. And it's a great event this year, they're going to feature 10 homes throughout the Bay Area. And these homes are breathtaking. You would just not believe the homes that they have. It's just amazing. Cool. Yeah, it's a virtual event you can do from home in your pajamas while you're sipping coffee if you'd like. So it's it's it's a really fun event, you have to see these homes if you have like interior design or architecture or if you just want to help raise money for the symphony and music education. It's it's a great, great event.




Patrick Hart  14:03  
Wow, I never knew really, besides maybe putting on concerts with the Santa Cruz Symphony league does. And I just think it's so great that they go into schools and really make such a positive impact. It sounds like in our community. Yeah, all




Patricia Greenway  14:18  
of all of the money that the symphony raises every year 100% of that money goes directly to the symphony to help support the symphony and the musicians and the music education programs that they do. And it's just such a nice addition to our community to have a symphony




Patrick Hart  14:37  
here. Okay, and now when you're racing around in your Porsche or around Laguna Seca, are you listening to Beethoven's Fifth or?












#Job fairs and employment support for people with disabilities.




Patricia Greenway  14:46  
Oh, I that's that's a mixed bag for me. I may listen to you know, Beethoven. I may listen to I don't know i That's a mixed bag. For me. I mix it up.




Patrick Hart  15:00  
But no matter what it is, it's probably pretty fun. Yeah,




Patricia Greenway  15:03  
I listen to a lot of Frank Sinatra. I find Frank Sinatra really hits home for me, I can never be in a bad mood when I listen to him. I just want to sing and dance and he always puts me in a great mood. Yeah, agreed. I think Come fly with me is one of my favorite songs by Frank Sinatra. Very good




Patrick Hart  15:19  
song. And you know, so you're at Soquel, which is your, your paid job. But I just was gonna ask like, what, what kind of environments do you work in at Soquel? Are you in an office? Or are you out moving around campus? Or what's it look like?




Patricia Greenway  15:33  
I do have an office and I do work with the special ed teacher. So I am in classrooms, often, I often will bring students into my office to meet with them privately if there are things that we want to work on like their resume or their applying for a job, or if they just need practice, with, you know, interviewing before they go to a job interview. I also meet one on one with students office, I just spent a lot of time floating around to the different special ed classrooms doing presentations and working with the students on you know, different activities. Okay.




Patrick Hart  16:05  
And with access to employment, you talked about that you guys put on different like employment type like expos or something like career expos. Yes, we




Patricia Greenway  16:15  
do an annual job fair every October. And we do it in October, because October is People With Disabilities Awareness one. And that's our main focus for access to employment is to really support employers who hire people with disabilities and support and to support people in our community who are job seekers that are looking for work that have disabilities. It's an annual job fair that's been going on since 1991. And last year, we had to do a Virtual Job Fair because of COVID restrictions, and you know, shelter, shelter and place restrictions. But it was a lot of fun. We worked very closely with Santa Cruz works who kind of helped us figure out the technical aspects of what platform to use for our virtual event and just kind of helped hold her hand and walk us through hosting a virtual event. It was something new for us as I think it was for many people in the world doing virtual events at that time. But we we had a great turnout with the number of job seekers that registered, I believe we had a record of over 400 job seekers that registered for our job fair. And we had more than a dozen, I believe employers who participated in the employers basically did a short presentation of their company and the work culture and talk about positions they're hiring for and what the hiring procedure was. So it was really nice for the job seekers to be able to hear that directly from those employers, instead of just trying to go to a website and fill out a job application and then never get a phone call. They could not only hear the presentation from the employer, but then we had breakout rooms where they could go and talk in small groups or one on one with those hiring managers from companies and kind of introduce themselves and ask questions directly to those hiring managers. Oh,




Patrick Hart  17:56  
that sounds great. And congratulations on what it's what sounds like a successful event.




Patricia Greenway  18:01  
Yeah, we were very happy. And it seemed like a lot of the employers and job seekers were very happy with the outcome of the event. And, you know, it was kind of a new thing for the companies and the job seekers to do a job fair online. So you know, it was nice to work with Santa Cruz works and have their support to help kind of walk us through that technical aspect of doing something new that we had never done before. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, we tried to set it up so that it was almost as if you were there in person at a live job fair. We wanted to do the breakout rooms so that people could go talk to hiring managers that they were interested in talking to and they didn't just have to hear the presentation, and then log in to try to fill out an online application or make a phone call to that hiring manager. They could just drop into the breakout room and introduce themselves and ask questions the same as you would if you went to a live in person job fair. And you kind of went to the employers that you were interested in talking to you would go to their exhibitor table and introduce yourself and present your resume and ask them questions and find out more about the workplace culture and what the hiring process was. Okay.




Patrick Hart  19:09  
And previously, when you guys were holding that event in person, is there a particular place where you would hold it? Yes, we




Patricia Greenway  19:17  
fortunately we were able to do our event in person this year, we did do an outdoor event just to kind of switch it up with COVID restrictions. We wanted people to be able to be outdoors and not have limitations on how many people we could have in the facility. But we always do our event at Coconut Grove. This year. We did it outside at the boardwalk I had attended. I had attended the Santa Cruz chamber business expo earlier this year, which I thought was a great event and it was so nice just to be outdoors without a mask being able to talk to people face to face and see people in the community that I hadn't been able to see because of COVID restrictions. So you know we've we felt we wanted to duplicate that same type of Have event, an outdoor event where people could come and still talk with people and not have to wear the mask if they chose not to. And we could spread the employers out and spread the jobseekers out without having confinement with restrictions on the number of people we could allow if it were an indoor event.




Patrick Hart  20:17  
Nice. That sounds great. Thank you for showing you Who doesn't




Patricia Greenway  20:20  
love being at the boardwalk being outside with fresh air looking at the ocean, right? I mean, it's such a great like place to be. So I think we may do more of our events outdoors like that at the boardwalk for sure.




#CAREER DEVELOPMENT, WRITING, AND EMPLOYMENT PREPARATION.




Patrick Hart  20:31  
Yeah, like definitely being out there in a beautiful setting. Like it's very inspiring. And I could just see how that would be like a win win. Yeah,




Patricia Greenway  20:39  
after after doing it at the boardwalk outside this year, we all just kind of looked at each other and said, you know, we should do our event outside all the time. This is great. Awesome.




Patrick Hart  20:47  
I know. That's like another silver lining, you know, that's come out of this is like, there's like more things like more restaurants have created outdoor seating in which I've always preferred to sit outside if I can, you know, warm. So like things like that. You know, there are there have been some silver linings.




Patricia Greenway  21:03  
Yes, yeah. And I'm just going to add to that I'm saying this because I have a dog, but I think a lot more restaurants because they now have the outdoor seating have been a lot more welcoming and a lot more dog friendly. And I love seeing that because it's so nice for families to be able to take their dog with him if they want to go have a meal together. Because dogs are such a huge part of your family




Patrick Hart  21:24  
for sure. And if you go to the bittersweet bistro they have the dogs have their own menu. Yes, yes. It's like pretty simple. It's like a chicken Patty maybe or like a beef thing. But anyways, I thought that was kind of funny. And fun, too. Yeah. You know the dog. Yeah, yeah, it is. For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the what to be show on KSQD Santa Cruz 90.7. FM. Patrick Hart, and I'm speaking with Patricia Greenway, who was on the board of directors and president of access to employment, and is a Career Specialist with Santa Cruz city schools, as well as on the board of directors for the Santa Cruz Symphony league. And Patricia, I was wondering, you know what, you do a lot of different interesting and great things in our community. And what would you say? What kind of skills do you use in your career? And how did you acquire these skills was it mainly just through working, maybe your personality type or through your education, background,




Patricia Greenway  22:19  
a combination of all of those. I do a lot of writing with all three of those positions. I also do a lot of graphic design with access to employment, and the symphony League, I also do a lot of online social media marketing and promoting with access to employment, and the symphony League. I've always been a very social person, and a very creative person. So I think all three of those positions offer me a great opportunity to utilize both of those the creativity and the the social aspect of just my true character. I was I was a former automotive journalist. I've always enjoyed writing, and I love cars and racing. So it was something I was very interested in at one point. And I was an automotive journalist for gosh, for I think, almost five years. And it really helped me kind of fine tune my my writing skills. And I use a lot of that with my career development specialist job with Santa Cruz city schools, I have to do reports, annual reports and monthly reports for the special ed students that I work with for their IEP meetings. And, you know, needless to say, with a lot of the the marketing that I do for access to employment and the symphony League, that also entails a lot of writing, whether it's, you know, creating a brochure, or creating a flyer or creating something for a website or creating a social media post. There's there's always a lot of writing that I do, I would say almost on a daily basis. I also write a lot of letters to employers and donors trying to raise money for the symphony League and then just writing letters to employers for access to employment and Santa Cruz city schools to try to encourage them to get involved with hiring youth or hiring people with disabilities in our in our community. Well,




Patrick Hart  24:11  
I think thank you for sharing that. And that seems like a common theme with a lot of people that I interview is that you know, just how much they value, the importance of writing. So yeah, I think that's a great skill to have.




#CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND JOB READINESS FOR YOUTH.




Patricia Greenway  24:24  
Yeah, I mean, I also do, you know, I, I developed a curriculum for employment preparation, not only for youth employment preparation, but I also developed an inmate employment preparation program with the Sheriff's Department. This was pre COVID. So I was going to two different jails in Santa Cruz County, working with inmates, helping them kind of prepare for reentry and finding employment and helping them get set up with things that they needed to do to secure employment and kind of reenter society. So you know, that obviously entailed a lot of writing but you know, With the workshops I do, there's a lot of resume and cover letter writing that I do with the inmates and the students that I work with. So that entails a lot of writing. So it takes a lot of skill for me to sit down with those folks and kind of coach them on using proper grammar using correct spelling, and you know how to word things when you're writing cover letters and resumes. And it's always fun for me to sit down with someone who says a student who says, I've never had a job, you're not gonna be able to do a resume for me, I have nothing to put on my resume. And then I sit down and I say, Okay, let's look at your qualifications. You're bilingual, right? Yes. Okay. Well, let's put that on your resume. Huh? You have a food handler certification, right? Yes. Okay. Well, let's put that on your resume. Let's see you've done babysitting. So you have your first aid and your CPR certification for babysitting, right? Yes. Okay. Well, let's add that to your resume. Okay, let's move on. Let's look at your experience. Well, I've never had a job. I don't have any experience. Okay, well, that's not true. You've done volunteering, right? You've done fundraising for the cheerleading squad here at school. So that's experience or you've done that career technical education class for bike bicycle technology, right? Yes. Okay, that's experience. And they go, Wow, I never knew I could put this stuff on my resume. Pa, okay, I guess I can do a resume. So it's always interesting to sit down with a youth who has never really thought about what they could put on their resume, because they have this misconception that just because they've never had a job before that they can't write a resume. So when I sit down with them, and they start developing a resume, they, they you almost like see their their face light up, because they feel proud of themselves that they've accomplished these things. And they do realize that they have experienced that will help them get their foot in the door for their first job. Oh,




Patrick Hart  26:45  
that's so great. And I think that that Santa Cruz city schools are very blessed to have you there doing the work that you're doing.




Patricia Greenway  26:51  
Thank you. I'm the fortunate one. Patricia, what kind of




Patrick Hart  26:55  
advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career in line with, you know, the different things that you do? I think one




Patricia Greenway  27:04  
of the top things I would advise not only students but parents as well, is make sure you're doing career assessments, when you're in high school, really try to get me even in middle school studies have shown that students who do career assessments in middle school and do career exploration are typically more likely to not only be successful in their careers, also tend to stick with those careers and tend to be happier in their careers. And I think that's because you've done research and you've really assessed your career path. And you've looked at different options, and you've made the choice that you feel is best for you. And I think doing career assessments is really important. So parents, if you have students in middle school in high school, I strongly advise you to, you know, work with them to do career assessments, you can go online and look for career assessments, there are lots of free resources that you can do. Naviance is a great one, O*NET, RIASEC. Those are all great career assessments that you can do with your children at home.




Patrick Hart  28:02  
Very good advice. Patricia. It's been a pleasure talking to and learning about all the wonderful things you're doing in our community and all the people that you're helping. Thank you very much.




Patricia Greenway  28:12  
Well, thanks for having me. I appreciate what you're doing. And I've always had a huge amount of appreciation for your futures, our business, they do so many wonderful things in the community. And I'm really excited that you that Brooks has accepted that position as executive director. I think she's doing great things. Yes,




Patrick Hart  28:28
