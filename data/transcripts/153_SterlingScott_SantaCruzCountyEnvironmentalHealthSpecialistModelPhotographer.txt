And today, I had the pleasure to speak to Sterling Scott, who is an environmental health specialist for the County of Santa Cruz. Hi, Sterling. Pretty good. Thank you so much for Hi, Sterling. Thanks for joining the program today. Really appreciate you being here.




Sterling Scott  0:51  
Thanks, Patrick. Thank you for having me.




Patrick Hart  0:53  
Right on. It hadn't. Thank you. I just drove up from LA. So I hope your trip wasn't too stressful getting here on time. Yeah, no, it




Sterling Scott  0:59  
wasn't too bad until the rain started pouring. And then I kind of freaked out a bit. I made it. So here I am awesome.




Patrick Hart  1:04  
Yeah, very grateful for you being here today. Sterling, would you please describe your career journey for us?




Sterling Scott  1:09  
That's a that's a difficult question. So currently, right now, I work for the County of Santa Cruz, as you said, as an environmental health specialist trainee. And basically what I do, I work in the land use division of that department. So going out throughout Santa Cruz County inspecting on site wastewater treatment systems. So ensuring water quality isn't being tampered with from the septic system. That's currently what I do now. But on my journey to getting there. I went to UCSC graduated in 2017, with a degree in Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology, got out of school started working in the hospital, started teaching was on the path to go to medical school still am. And then I got into art explored that and as a photographer, and model produced two books. So trying to find this balance between being an artist and then also being a scientist. But all of that is just kind of involved with public service. Right. So giving back to the community giving back to the people, which is why I'm here right now. Yeah,




Patrick Hart  2:16  
thank you so much. And that's super, you know, your degree is impressive. You know, it's intimidating sounding, right. Oh, no,




Sterling Scott  2:23  
it's just a regular biodegrade. You know, but some fancy words in there.




Patrick Hart  2:27  
Okay. And so, you know, recently I've heard in Watsonville, that there has been this smell, you know, having behind you know about that?




Sterling Scott  2:34  
Yeah. So, yeah, we've gotten the calls and the complaints about the smell. And it was actually our water quality team at the lab down there on emaline. That ended up, you know, doing some tracking and figuring out where the smell was coming from. So, I mean, I could dive into it a little bit. No,




Patrick Hart  2:51  
no, we don't have to go. Yeah. You know, I've heard a lot of talk about it recently. Yeah, apparently, they found where the sources and the other thing. Cool. And then what kind of work were you doing for the hospital? Was that during school, or did that come afterwards?




Sterling Scott  3:05  
So that was after school. So I ended up doubling up between working as a substitute teacher teaching science classes back home, so local high school is out there. And then I was working at a local hospital, in the radiology department, so I was a patient transport specifically for radiology. But you know, that kind of over it. It was linked with both the ER, O R, and also inpatient. So I got to see, you know, those three dynamics at the hospital. And at the time, I wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon. So dealing with bones and muscles, I'm seeing broken legs, and broken hip or hip replacements. What else? Double plateau, knee, knee surgeries the whole gambit. So and




Patrick Hart  3:50  
that's something that you're still considering pursuing.




Sterling Scott  3:52  
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe not surgery so much. But the whole point of again, giving back and being able to give back to somebody, it was the whole reason why I wanted to become a doctor in the first place. So things have kind of shifted, you know, because I have other interests that I'm still trying to explore. Right. But, you know, I have my head and my heart in the right place. And I think when you do that, you know, and stick to your guns, you'll always, you know, move on the right path, no matter how long it takes, right? Yeah,




#PHOTOGRAPHY, MENTORSHIP, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.




Patrick Hart  4:24  
yeah. Thanks for sharing that. I agree with you. And you know, you you mentioned that you wrote a couple of bucks.




Sterling Scott  4:32  
Well, they're most of photography books. So I wish I wrote some books. To the first one. Well, both books actually did with a friend. So in the first book that's called reflection of us. It's basically about black men. And what we go through and we came up with this concept from are both two different perspectives. He's like a mentor and friend little bit older than I am. So he's looking at a different angle, and then I'm looking at it from what I'm currently going through right now. And And so I was moreso, the model in that book, and he was moreso, the photographer, but it was still our collaboration of ideas. And coming up with the looks, and like those moments, those emotions, all of that. So that was the first book and then the second book. And most more recently, as I can't breathe, and after the events of George Floyd and 2020, we said, hey, we need to document this. So all throughout LA, we went to a bunch of different protest, rallies, services, anything that you can think of, especially at the height of the pandemic. That was what May of 2020, May of last year. So we went all around town and compiled all these images to make this, you know, this piece to submit that moment in history. And for me, it felt like my own civil rights movement, you know, I've only read about it or watched it in TV, but actually being there was a whole different field. So that was something I'm really proud of. Yeah, to be able to do,




Patrick Hart  6:02  
I'm sure. And that might have been kind of emotional, you know, creating that, right? Yeah,




Sterling Scott  6:06  
yeah, definitely. You see the tears. You see the tears, you feel the anger, you feel the pain. But I think the most interesting thing that we did in this book, we didn't want to make it completely about just, you know, people hurting, right. We know that people are hurting, but we kind of tapered it off at the end with like the Juneteenth Celebration. So it's like, even though we go through all of these struggles, and we're trying to make change, right, we're trying to protest to fight a system that is crippling, at times, you know, that doesn't mean that we don't get to celebrate or be proud of ourselves or love who we are. And we have that whole kind of revolving thing. Yeah, that tone that message flowing throughout the book? Well,




Patrick Hart  6:56  
it sounds like you have a great perspective. You know, and I'm sure you probably inspire a lot of people with what you're doing.




Sterling Scott  7:01  
I mean, I hope so. I just say, you know, I just live life, you know, and that's it. And if people are inspired, then then I'm humbled, you know, that people are, are inspired by the work that I do, or the work that I shall do, or the work that I've done. You know, it took somebody to inspire me, you know, or to give me an opportunity and give me a chance. So why wouldn't I do the same thing for somebody else? You know, Yeah, agreed.




Patrick Hart  7:27  
And, you know, you mentioned that you had a mentor, and I just think, having a mentor in life, or mentors, like how valuable that is, you know,




Sterling Scott  7:35  
everybody needs somebody, you know, and whatever like that you can think of somebody that you need someone to talk to somebody to talk to you about business, someone to talk to about careers, someone to guide you, through your art, whatever the case may be, find somebody, or multiple people, I've had multiple people, right. And, you know, once you have those people always go back to them and say, like, hey, you know, follow up with them. Like, you haven't helped me with this. Yeah. Like, I'm still trying to figure this out. Can you tell me, you know, how to do this? Or how did you do it? And then how can I replicate it? And either do it better or do a bigger, you know?




Patrick Hart  8:10  
Yeah. And I'd imagine, you know, you might be inspired by your mentor in the beginning, but there comes a point where maybe you're inspiring the mentor to or like, lets you know,




Sterling Scott  8:20  
yeah, you know, it's funny, I was just having a conversation with him today. And he was like, you know, man, you say that you look up to me, and he's like, but you don't know how much like, I look up to you. And so it is that give and take, right? Because it's a shared experience. We're all learning in this process. And I think the issue is, most people aren't open enough. Sometimes Sometimes we want to, we open up just a bit, and then we close off to the point where we're like, okay, you know, I've opened up too much, I can't move any, any any, you know, I can't move forward anymore. And then, that's when we're like, Okay, we're done. Right? Instead of just saying, you know, I'm just gonna relax. I'm gonna let this be. And then I'm gonna see what happens. And usually, it's always a beautiful positive thing when we don't shut off before you know, we reap those blessings. Sterling. Do




Patrick Hart  9:08  
you think that maybe that the ego, the pesky ego can get in the way sometimes always,




Sterling Scott  9:13  
always gets? Right. It makes you self doubt. Yeah.




Patrick Hart  9:17  
Yeah. And going back to your job right now. Do you want to talk just briefly about kind of what your daily duties and responsibilities are?




#WATER MANAGEMENT AND PHOTOGRAPHY.




Sterling Scott  9:25  
Yeah. So I mean, it's probably not as interesting as about the art stuff. It's still pretty interesting, right? So so important. Yeah, it is important, right? So I didn't know this. I actually just learned this recently. But Santa Cruz is one of the only counties I think in, in California that doesn't get water from another resource. So all of our water is groundwater. Right? So that's so essential that we protect that as you know, as we have a growing population here and people are moving to Santa Cruz, which is great, but then We're also like, Okay, well, what are we going to do with the water. And so that's where I've started to realize why my job is so important. But a typical day for me is I usually work with a lot of contractors and consultants. So people are trying to build their ad use and do all these different things, which is fine. But we have to come out and inspect, like, Hey, what are your soil types, so we do a dig, test the soil and look at it to see, you know, how fast or how slow water permeate through that soil. And then we come up with a plan to say, Hey, this is the best system that you can have, you know, so I pretty much guide or I walk with the contractors and the property owners through that process, making sure that everything is up to cold so that they can get the project they want. And then we also say, hey, you know, you're abiding by Santa Cruz County Environmental Health standards.




Patrick Hart  10:48  
Okay. And Sterling, you're from Los Angeles. And I was surprised to learn that LA gets a lot of its water from up here from like, is it the San Luis reservoir?




Sterling Scott  10:58  
Well, Ellie gets his water from a few different places, actually. Part of the water I think 10% comes from the Colorado River. You know, so we're draining water from everywhere. So maybe desalinization and in LA will work better, right. Okay, that ocean water?




Patrick Hart  11:14  
Yeah, I agree. And, you know, just what is your kind of typical day and week look like? Are you working like predominantly like, indoors like in, you know, doing like, in front of the computer? Or are you out in the field to do like your samples and




Sterling Scott  11:28  
typical week, let's see. I'm probably in the office for about, I'm gonna say four hours. So I get in pretty early. I'm in the office about four hours of responding to emails, and then I'm pretty much booked, like, towards the end of the day, like, I'm going to site so I stand in South County mostly, so I'm all the way in Watsonville and Coroalitos La Selva, I love the beach. So that's always a plus, but I'm in the field. Most of the time, you know, that's pretty nice, you know, to be out there moving around. Yeah, it's great. It's great. It's the best balance of not, you know, it's a clerical job at times, but being able to be in the field, and you're not stuck somewhere where I'm like sitting and typing all day. So I enjoy that aspect of it.




Patrick Hart  12:19  
And I think you know, when you and I met for tea the other day, and you tell me, you know about a little bit about your photography, and that you were doing something with Santa Cruz. Hi, were you doing portraits? Maybe or?




Sterling Scott  12:29  
Yeah, so that day, this is not the days are all jumbled up? was so much photography work, right? So it was on Friday, I actually got invited to look at some of the students portfolio. So doing portfolio review, and then also sharing a bit of my work. So I showed them some of the work that I do, I really like to specialize in portraits, and street photography, documenting style stuff. So telling stories, so I got to express my way of like telling stories, because I think that we all share stories, right? Even growing up, like your grandma used to tell you like, Oh, back, I'm out. And you know, we would sit there and laugh and sell photography or videography film, it's all the same. It's like that same sort of tool to share a story, right? But what that story is, it can be personal, it can be story about someone else. We all need to hear those stories, right? Because that's allows us to grow mature, you know, and to come up with new ways new innovation to how we live. Yeah,




#CAREER GOALS, INTERESTS, AND BALANCING WORK AND ART.




Patrick Hart  13:28  
agreed? And do you want to share some of the skills that you use in your, in your current job? You know, maybe with what you do for the, for the county? Are there is there, you know, things that you've learned in school, probably that are helping you there.




Sterling Scott  13:44  
You know, yeah, speaking skills, being able to deal with difficult people sometimes. And then sticking to your guns, right? If you know that something's wrong, then just say it, you know, being being able to use your voice, I think is like a really big deal in this field. Because someone could take advantage of, you know, trying to make like a really cheap system or getting away with something that isn't probably the best route to go down to definitely using that. And then my science, science and math, it's always going to like come up in most fields. Even photography, science and math when you when you really think about it, like knowing how to manipulate the camera and editing using light right, to manipulate those photos or get different colors on there. But yeah, my science, probably not the medical science that comes into play, but a lot of the environmental stuff where I've taken classes on that definitely comes into play. Okay.




Patrick Hart  14:45  
And did you share with me that, that doing this job that you're going to earn a certain type of like certification or something?




Sterling Scott  14:53  
Yeah, so right now I'm currently a trainee, and it takes about for me, I think it's gonna take a year and then I have to take a test to get certified with the state to officially become an rdhs, specialist or registered environmental, environmental health specialist.




Patrick Hart  15:09  
Okay. Do you see yourself working in this, you know, this particular field for a certain amount of time? Or, you know, you didn't talk about wanting to go back to maybe medical school? Yeah.




Sterling Scott  15:19  
So I do have a few possibilities of that, like, right now I've been, I love talking to people, because that's how you get information. So medical school is still on the agenda. I met this wonderful PA, who told me she only works two days a week and is buying this amazing, she only bought this property and she's gonna build this huge house on it. And okay, so there's an option that looks kind of nice. And then the other thing is, say, if I do work in this field and moving up the ranks as far as like policymaking, I've been thinking about, well, maybe I can go back and get my MPH. So while I work, I take online classes and do a master's in public health program. So moving up that way?




Patrick Hart  15:59  
Well, I think it's super inspiring that you have so many different interests, you know, from like, the left brain, right brain like, yeah, right.




Sterling Scott  16:08  
I think it becomes difficult sometimes, you know, as well. And then I'm also a Gemini, so I'm already in my head to begin with. But you know, what I can say is the cool part. Now, I think, when my parents were coming up, they just got a job. And they worked. And that's what it was right? Now, we can actually create our own jobs for ourselves, right, and interweave the things that we like, and I'm really, I'm just kind of starting to discover that. And then I'm like, okay, like this, this can actually work. You know, I'm like, just really trying to figure out how do you balance and manage your time? I think that's the, that's our biggest issue. Once you figure out how to balance and manage your time, you're like, hey, you know, or, for me, for instance, I'm an artist, I love being an artist. I love taking photos. I love film. I love that whole Brown, right? But then I had to get rid of myself, I'm like, I need to pay bills. So I'm like, Well, what can I do with the things that I already know, to pay the bills? And then how can I use the spare time that I have to do my art, right? And I've been making it work, you know, slowly, but surely. And then as one takes off, and I  become set on the bills, the bill department, the photography is going to start taking off, right? And then you can make your shift, right? I'm not saying that this works for everybody. This is just what it works for me. But some people can get into their art and do their thing and make it boom, there are artists, you know, painters, writers, producers, actors, singers, musicians, and that's what they do. And that works great for them. Right? But you have to figure out your own way, what works for you, you know, so play around with it a little bit. You know, we have all the time in the world, literally, we do. But, you know, we get ahead of ourselves, and then we start to rush. And then that's where we make the mistake.




Patrick Hart  17:54  
Yeah, like life can get complicated. And then we start, you know, it feels like, you know, we kind of like maybe put limitations on ourselves, you know,




#ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST JOB AND WATER QUALITY PROTECTION.




Sterling Scott  18:02  
yeah, we do. We do instead of living in the moment taking it day by day, step by step. Yeah, granted, things are gonna pop up that are out of our control. But when they pop up, say, hey, let's take a deep breath. How do we deal with this? And then we get back and then continue on our path. Just keep that goal in mind.




Patrick Hart  18:16  
Yeah, thank you very much for sharing that. For those who are just tuning in. You're listening to the what to be show on KSQD Santa Cruz, 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart. And I'm speaking with Sterling Scott, who's an environmental health specialist, among other things, an artist for the County of Santa Cruz. Sterling, you want to talk about some of your more favorite projects that you have worked on or are currently working on?




Sterling Scott  18:41  
Like, as a photographer, yeah,




Patrick Hart  18:43  
just you know, in either, you know, with anything that you do, or have done, yeah.




Sterling Scott  18:48  
Every project that I that I'm currently working on or have, oh, I guess I just say this. So a project that I'm actually currently trying to work on is another art show. So hopefully, more information to come soon. But in the next few months, I'll have some artwork up at a local brewery in Scotts Valley. So I'm really excited about that. I'm a little pissed because I've been taking too much time and trying to figure out what do I put up on the walls, but I think I have it down. I think I'm just gonna do something centered around like the ocean and I believe like the ocean has like this whole healing thing to it. So creating like a series of image will have the imagery and just got to get it framed and and select the right images that are going to be presented at the show. Yeah, that's, that's something that I'm really working on. And hopefully I get back down to to North Carolina. I was working on a project with one of my old lecturers from UCSC documenting master foxhounds so hanging out with with horses all day and going out on foxhounds and now this is something that this man has done his Live and I think he's in his 70s now still hops up on a horse. Like he's a young buck like me, and definitely rides better than me. Young at heart maybe? Most definitely. Yeah, most. That's really cool.




Patrick Hart  20:13  
And, you know, what kind of person do you think would enjoy doing your job that you're doing with the county as an environmental health specialist? Hmm.




Sterling Scott  20:24  
Well, one person, a person that loves environmental protection, let's definitely, there's tons of room of growth for that. So if you love the environment, you would definitely be interested in this job also, like bureaucratic like policy, you know, this, this is heavily involved with policy and enforcing code. So if their brains work like that, and bad mindset as well, it would be beneficial for




Patrick Hart  20:47  
them to Yeah, and it seems like our area attracts, you know, people that are definitely thinking about the environment. Yeah,




Sterling Scott  20:53  
most definitely. There's tons of, you know, stuff, people add natural bridges, or, you know, water quality water preservation water resources is another division within our department. So we kind of overlap too. Yeah. So yeah, very cool.




Patrick Hart  21:08  
And do you want to talk about, you know, I think we all know, but do you just want to kind of more elaborate further on why your job isn't important to you? And artist society?




Sterling Scott  21:18  
Uh, yeah. It's, I mean, it's important, again, protecting our water quality. I think that that's what the next fight in the world is going to be. It's going to be over water. I know what's coming. I'm just trying to figure out how do I like create water? You know, now. So when that does happen, you know, people can come to me, and I'm like, Hey, I got the liquid gold here. But, yeah, protecting water quality, right. That's, that's one of our biggest things, but we need water to survive. So yeah, making sure that we're not, you know, impeding, or we're not damaging or corrupting those sources of water that's essential to our lives. Yeah. That's, that's the most important part of our job. But then also, you know, health and safety as well. So, you know, we're looking at not so much in my department, but you know, the consumer protection, who goes out to restaurants, making sure that you're not eating from like, a bad place, or they have healthy practices. And I think even more so now with COVID. You know, we all kind of want to be a little safe when it comes to our health and what we drink or ingest.




Patrick Hart  22:27  
Yeah. And you see things that happen in other parts of the country. In Flint, Michigan, Michigan. Oh, yeah. That's pretty scary.




Sterling Scott  22:34  
That's pretty scary. Could you imagine having like black water, just run out your faucet?




#CAREER PATH AND JOB DUTIES AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST.




Patrick Hart  22:38  
I know, that's just seems unimaginable. It should be. Is your job full time? Are you working 40 hours a week for the counties? Yes, I do work full time. 40 hours a week. Okay. And you're still finding time to take your pictures? And do you have a website for your photography, I don't have




Sterling Scott  22:56  
a website. But if you go on to Flickr, and you type in my name is Sterling Scott, or you can type in might come up Sterling gold. And I'll see what I did there. You should be able to find me, I should pop it up. And then you can check that out.




Patrick Hart  23:11  
Okay. Very cool. And did you What did you find surprising about your job at county when you started?




Sterling Scott  23:17  
I probably shouldn't say this because I think people kind of care. So the first thing that I found, so I didn't know exactly what I was going to be doing when I took the job. I had like the description. But they didn't say what Division I was gonna be in. So I knew absolutely nothing about septic systems coming here. That was completely I mean, I lived in a city like everything is sewere. So I got here and they're like, Yeah, you know, we have these systems, where like, your stuff goes in. And I was like, What? What is that like? Well, I think




Patrick Hart  23:50  
that's common for most of us. Right? It is sort of, but that's about it.




Sterling Scott  23:54  
Right? Right. Right. So I think what is it 30% of American civilization actually lives on something new, right? Not me. Yeah, I didn't know. Yeah, but yeah, so I didn't know anything about the job. I think that's what surprised me most. But I've been learning a lot. And it's actually like pretty cool. Information, especially designing these systems and some of these alternative treatments. I don't want to get too scientific, but you know, we actually use certain bacteria to actually clean our poop. So




Patrick Hart  24:23  
who knew? Is there is there anything you know, is there gonna share maybe one of the most stressful parts of your job, if any?




Sterling Scott  24:33  
Yeah, it does get stressful, right? Everybody wants stuff done immediately. So I'm getting calls left and right all day. When is this has been approved? Yeah, I go down that whole gambit, and I just tell people look, I'm working as fast as I can. You know, I do try to expedite the process a little bit. I know things have been super stressful or they just hired three of us on at once and they really needed the help because I think it was only two people for the whole county or three people for the whole county. So how, you know, people have all these projects that they want to do, and then everything is completely backlogged. So, we've actually been kind of breaking down that process and getting people, you know, their permits and stuff that they need.




Patrick Hart  25:17  
Okay. And Sterling, what advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career in line with what you do for the county as, as an environmental health specialist, or an aspiring artist, photographer, or model, even,




Sterling Scott  25:32  
I would say, first and foremost, have a mentor, come up with a game plan, and then really sit with yourself and ask yourself, what do you want to do. And whatever it is that you want to do, do it, I would say get your degree, if you want to get into becoming an environmental health specialist, or anything in public health or something like that, you need a degree. And I know people say have have had the talk, like, you don't always need a degree, that's true. But for that field, you do need a degree. So I would suggest get a degree, you know, higher education always helps. And then being an artist, photographer, whatever you want to do, just start now, do a little bit, once a day, if you're a photographer, pick up a camera, take a picture of once a day, you do it once a day, 365 days a year, you're gonna have an entire album, done by the end of the year, right? Or you could take bits and pieces and compile, you have your portfolio. So the work is already done. It's just a matter of trying to figure out how do we present it? And that's, that's like the next part. Awesome,




Patrick Hart  26:37  
great advice. And you know, if nothing else, you know, I'd imagine that your photography for people, maybe it's therapeutic in a way to Yes, yeah. And did you share with me, you know, when we're having tea the other day that if you earn your degree that after you take a test that you can become a substitute teacher? Oh, yeah.




Sterling Scott  26:55  
Yeah. So that's, my mom actually told me this trick. So in the state of California, as soon as you have your degree, so I think it was the day after I graduated, and I'm like, Oh, I got my diploma. I'm sitting taking the CBEST. I forgot what it stands for. But basically, it gives you your, it allows you to apply for your 30 day sub credential. So if you don't have any job, you need something to do. You can always be a teacher. Yeah.




Patrick Hart  27:18  
That sounds like a really good just resource. I kind of just in case type thing to have in your backpack. I




Sterling Scott  27:23  
always is, you know, especially when you're trying to figure it out. And you need some extra cash. Yeah, it's a quick resource. Yeah. Right on.




Patrick Hart  27:29  
And can you certainly would you briefly give us advice for someone who is potentially unsure about their career path?




Sterling Scott  27:37  
Yeah. If you're unsure. The first thing I would say is don't beat yourself up over it. I'm the perfect example. Not that I've been completely unsure. But I haven't 100% committed yet. Because I think when you're when you're good at so many different things you're trying to figure out well, what do I do? Right? So yeah, don't beat yourself up over that. Just be easy on yourself. Take time, it'll come to you. And then maybe just start to dabble in a few different things. And then the thing that hooks you explore that more, keep going down that path and then figure out what it is. That's drawing you in. Nice, beautifully
