Today, we have a special guest here, Murry Schekman. My father, thanks for being here today, Dad.

Murry Schekman 1:01  
My pleasure, Jacob, what a treat. Hi, Melina.

Melina 1:05  
Hi, welcome, Murry.

Jacob 1:05  
Murry is a lecturer at San Jose State University in counselor education and a trainer of new administrators for the Santa Cruz County Office of Education.

Jacob 1:14  
Can you tell us a little bit about your career and your career journey and how you ended up where you are today?


# CAREER JOURNEY

Murry Schekman 1:24  
Well, it's my pleasure. It's truly a treat to be here. As you two know, I serve on the board for Your Future Is Our Business. So I'm a proud board member. I presently teach at San Jose State, I am a full-time lecturer in the counseling department. I also worked in the leadership department teaching future administrators. That department seemed to go away, and so now I'm full-time in counseling. How that happened, though, and I do want to talk more about my earlier part of my career is I was a teacher, a counselor, and then a school administrator in the world of K-12 in four different communities. I retired from that world in 2015. Before that, I had been teaching part-time at San Jose, and after retiring, I was invited to pick up more sections, and I'm now full-time. As a lecturer, I participate in many activities, but I'm not a tenure-track staff member. So there's pressure that they feel that I don't feel, but knowing how Your Future Is Our Business works, I'd really like to focus on the career of teaching and being in the world of K-12. I hope that's okay with the two of you.

Jacob 2:31  
Absolutely. Tell us about how you found yourself in the world of teaching. What was it like getting in there?

Murry Schekman 2:37  
It was a long time ago. I was a student at San Jose State and then transferred and graduated from UCSC, where I got my teaching credential and my bachelor's in sociology. There were no jobs back then in 1975. I was forewarned by my college advisor, "Why don't you consider something else? There's really no jobs."

Melina 3:01  
Were there no jobs in teaching in general, or were they filled?

Murry Schekman 3:05  
There were no jobs in teaching in general at that point in time. It's surprising now because there's a huge shortage. The sad thing to reflect on is that back then a teacher could buy a home. You can't do that now. You need two teachers' incomes to buy a home, especially in Santa Cruz County. I went off to college thinking I would major in journalism, possibly become a lawyer, or become a teacher. In my sophomore year at San Jose State, I got a job in special ed on the east side of San Jose at O. S. Hubbard Elementary. I was inspired working with special needs kids developing their gross motor skills. I made the decision that journalism and law were not in my future. I transferred to UCSC, entered the teaching credential program, did my student teaching at Aptos High with a fantastic teacher named Bob Huston. There were no jobs, so I started at Watsonville High as a long-term sub. The teacher I subbed for had surgery and couldn't come back, so I got lucky with a job in my first year out of college as a math teacher at Watsonville High. I didn't end up as a math teacher after that year.


# TEACHING EXPERIENCES

Murry Schekman 5:15  
I loved math, but let's just say I wasn't a math teacher. I majored in sociology, I'm bilingual in Spanish and English, and I ended up teaching other subjects. Watsonville and I parted ways. I went to a private high school in Santa Cruz, Morello Prep, which is no longer in existence. I taught social studies, some math, and a few other subjects. In private school, they have you teach a lot, and I loved it. I enjoyed the kids and the community, but I knew public schools were where I wanted to be. Public schools welcome all people, and I wanted to be part of that. I got lucky and got a job at North Monterey County High School in 1978, a brand-new school in Castroville. I worked for a brilliant principal, Walt Holmes, who was my mentor. He convinced me that leadership was in my future. It's important to find mentors and build a network. In teaching, it's easy to do that because teachers are collaborators.

Jacob 6:35  
What was it like being a teacher in different communities and transitioning to different roles?

Murry Schekman 6:40  
After North Monterey County, I got my first administrative position at EA Hall Middle School in Watsonville as an assistant principal. I handled discipline for the first year and thought it would be challenging, but I loved it. I realized that bringing in parents helped families. After that, I went to Watsonville High as an assistant, then got my first principalship in San Mateo at Bayside Middle School, which had 36 different languages. Later, I returned to EA Hall and then opened a new high school in Salinas, Everett Alvarez High School. I was hired a year before it opened and worked with kids, parents, and teachers. It turned out to be a wonderful school. However, being a parent myself, I had to recognize what was more important. Family is much more important. My son, Jacob, once told me he would call Dr. Lee Sancho to stop having meetings with me because he wanted me home. That made me realize I needed to balance work and family. Eventually, I returned to Watsonville as a principal and later became the Assistant Superintendent in charge of secondary education, retiring in 2015.

Jacob 8:30  
That's quite a journey. What motivated you to stay in education and continue teaching at the university level?

Murry Schekman 8:35  
The things that excited me were the people. I wanted to be in a place with people. Teaching is a 100% collaborative industry. If you're thinking about being a teacher, let me talk you into it. There's a shortage of teachers, especially bilingual ones. Teaching is extremely fulfilling. Now, teaching at the university level, nine out of ten days are excellent. If you're wondering about teaching, visit a school, hang out, shadow a teacher, and familiarize yourself with the career.


# TEACHING VS. UNIVERSITY LECTURING

Jacob 10:30  
Just a quick reminder for those of you who are just tuning in, you're listening to "What to Be" at KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob and I'm joined by Melina. We're speaking with Murry Schekman and learning about his career journey in K-12 education.

Melina 10:46  
You mentioned different careers in the field of education. What is it like being a teacher day-to-day, and what decisions are important if you want to be a K-12 teacher versus a university lecturer?

Murry Schekman 11:04  
Being a teacher is extremely hard work. If you want something easy, don't be a teacher. Teaching is an extremely difficult job every day if you do it right. Elementary, middle, and high school teaching have different challenges. Elementary teachers deal with the whole child, covering multiple subjects. Middle school teachers address the unique developmental needs of adolescents. High school teachers prepare students for the real world, balancing advanced placement classes, remedial classes, and extracurricular activities like athletics. College teaching is different because students pay to attend, are highly motivated, and there are no discipline problems. College professors need to publish and have different pressures. As a lecturer, I'm not on a tenure track, so my pressures are different. Teaching now is a joy for me because I can pass on my knowledge and experiences to the next generation.

Melina 14:52  
Going back to the differences between elementary school, middle school, high school, and higher education, what else should someone consider when choosing between these different levels of teaching?

Murry Schekman 15:05  
In middle and high school, you need to be available for activities beyond the school day. High school teachers often have to supervise evening events like sports games, which are an essential part of the school community. Middle school has less of that, and elementary even less so. High school teachers need to be part of a broader community, involving themselves in clubs and athletics. College teaching, while still involving community, has different pressures. Students are there voluntarily and have intrinsic motivation. College teaching requires deep research and internal motivation, while K-12 teaching requires creating engaging and motivating environments for students.

Jacob 16:00  
That's an excellent overview of the differences. Can you describe a typical day or week for you when you were a K-12 teacher?


# DAY-TO-DAY TEACHING EXPERIENCE

Murry Schekman 16:07  
Sure. Let's go back to when I was a first-year math teacher at Watsonville High. Every teacher gets one prep period a day, and back then, students took six classes. So, I taught five classes a day, each roughly 55 minutes long. I had two geometry classes and three algebra classes. I'd start my day by getting to the high school early, checking into the math office, and making sure everything was in order in my classroom. I had one class with 55 students, which was a challenge, but it worked out well. A good part of each class involved 20 minutes of direct instruction, followed by working in small groups or with individual students.

During my prep period, I would correct papers, plan lessons, and consult with veteran math teachers like Kathy Anderson, the department chair, to ensure I was on track. Surrounding myself with experienced teachers was crucial. Lunch was a time to recharge, often with a good homemade meal from the cafeteria. After lunch, I needed a cup of coffee to keep my energy up for the rest of the day.

Interacting with students was the highlight of my day. Some students thrived and were excited about learning, while others struggled due to various personal challenges. I made it a point to get to know my students personally, understanding their backgrounds and family situations. This personal connection made a significant difference in their learning experience.


# ADMINISTRATIVE ROLES AND HIRING TEACHERS

Jacob 22:48  
For those just tuning in, you're listening to "What to Be" at KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob, and I'm joined by my co-host Melina. We're speaking with Murry Schekman and learning about his journey to becoming a lecturer at San Jose State University in counselor education and a trainer of new administrators in the Santa Cruz County Office of Education.

Melina 23:11  
Before the break, you mentioned being a principal. Did you have to hire teachers?

Murry Schekman 23:19  
Oh, my goodness, yes. Hiring teachers is a significant part of the job, especially when opening a new school. At Everett Alvarez High School, I hired everyone.

Melina 23:31  
What factors go into hiring a teacher you'd want versus one you wouldn't?

Murry Schekman 23:36  
Excellent question. The most important factor was their heart for students, not just their knowledge of the content. Pedagogical skills can be developed, but compassion for kids can't be taught. I also valued teachers with diverse backgrounds. I hired military veterans and people who had other careers before teaching. They brought a broader perspective and understood what kids go through outside of school. It's essential to find teachers who have a heart for students and can articulate it, and who bring diverse experiences to the classroom.

Melina 25:03  
When you first became a teacher, what is something you wish you would have known?

Murry Schekman 25:10  
I wish I had known how hard it was. It didn't chase me away, but I realized after my first few years that teaching is much harder than I initially thought. It's a very demanding job, but also incredibly rewarding. I also started learning Spanish at the age of 20 and spent several vacations in Mexico to immerse myself in the language. This opened up many opportunities for me, especially in bilingual education. Learning Spanish and becoming bilingual was a smart move that benefited my career tremendously.

Melina 26:39  
The last question we have for you is, what is a piece of advice or a resource you would like to leave our listeners with?

Murry Schekman 26:46  
First, build your own network. Find people in the career or related careers you want to pursue, and they will help you. Don't be afraid to ask for help, and if you're shy, ask in pairs. Another important piece of advice is to anticipate. Try to anticipate what's next, not just in your career but in life. Know your students and their families, not just the students themselves. Lastly, make sure you find fulfillment in your job. You need to enjoy your job nine out of ten days. If you dread going to work every morning, something is wrong, and you may need to find a different job. There are always training opportunities available for any career you want to pursue.
