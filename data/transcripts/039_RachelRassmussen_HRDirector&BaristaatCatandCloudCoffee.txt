Jacob Schekman 0:53
Today, we're joined by Rachel Rasmussen. Thank you for being here today.

Rachel Rasmussen 0:58
Thanks, guys.

Jacob Schekman 1:00
Rachel is here to talk about being a barista and human resources concierge at Cat and Cloud Coffee. Now, Rachel, can you tell us a little bit about that organization and what you do in each of your roles?

Rachel Rasmussen 1:13
Yeah, definitely. Cat and Cloud originally interested me because of the mission statement of the company: it is to leave people happier than when we found them. And so that works throughout every section of the company, whether it's the guests that come in for coffee, or toast and pastries, or the staff that work there every day, or the people who deliver our produce. And so I saw that so clearly, as a guest of the cafe when the mail person would come in to drop off a package and the barista would offer them a cup of coffee on their way out. It made me realize that the company cared more about people than coffee. And that's something I've always been so interested in, is people. And so I was so excited to just get to work with people who cared about other people. So originally, I started working there about a year ago, as a full-time barista, doing five days a week, giving people their morning cup of coffee as they're off to work or enjoying their Saturday. And then I started to realize that there was more in the company as we're growing and soon to have four stores in Santa Cruz. The administrative aspect of the company interested me a lot. So back in March, I applied to be an executive assistant for one of the owners and did that for a little while and was so excited by the background of the company. And then about three months ago, I started working in the human resources department. So we do hiring and payroll and benefits, PTO. Yeah, it gets pretty busy, especially during the holiday season of hiring.

# DAILY ROUTINE

Jacob Schekman 2:40
Yeah, as we mentioned pre-show, I'm working at Verve, I definitely get that. I kind of understand what you're talking about, about working in these holidays. What is a day or week of your life like in terms of either being a barista or human resources? Wait, so just so I understand you, you do both, right? So how often, how much time do you spend in the cafe and outside also working for the company?

Rachel Rasmussen 3:05
Yeah, so I do both. Three days a week, I'm in the cafe and two days a week I am doing administrative work. The administrative work is really fun for me because I get to work at any of our cafes, or I could work at home. Sometimes I work at Verve to mix up my life a little bit. So I love that I'm not stuck in necessarily showing up at the same place at the same time every day. I have flexibility in my schedule. But yeah, being a barista is so much fun for me because I get to see so many people every day. And we as a staff create relationships with the guests that come in, know their names and their stories, and get to ask about trips they went on and the kind of like, "Oh, your mom's coming in town for Thanksgiving. How was that? Was it okay?" And just being able to get to know the people that come in.

Jacob Schekman 3:52
Some of those interactions can make your day, right?

Rachel Rasmussen 3:55
Oh, 100%. They make my day all the time. And it's so fun to get to know these people and with the mindset of also wanting to make their day. Yeah, it's pretty impactful. Most of the time, I joke that being a barista is just hosting a party. And that's just what you do. We laugh and have fun. We also have to move really quick on weekends and I end up covered in avocado and coffee. I leave work and I'm like, I smell like avocado toast and a latte and I'm like, "Okay, time to shower." But the other days of the week that I'm working on admin stuff, it's a lot of meetings with my boss Tanner, who is in charge of the whole human resources department. We meet and right now I'm in quite a learning process of our payroll organization that we use. It's quite complex to work with a company that has 60-something employees, trying to figure out making sure everyone has the right sick policy and paid time off policy and holiday pay. And it's a lot of calling our provider and saying, "How do I do this?" So it's fun for me to learn as I go and know that I don't need to know everything to get into this sort of career.

# SKILLS AND LEARNING

Jacob Schekman 5:04
What sorts of skills do you think you gained from working here, and what do you think you wish you had before?

Rachel Rasmussen 5:13
I think I gained, one of the first skills that comes to mind is the ability to follow up with people. So a lot of my job is asking people questions or trying to get information from them. And I think now I've crafted a much better way of being like, "Hey, excuse me, I really need that from you today," while also just caring about them and making sure I'm taking my time well. As a barista, I've learned so much about meeting people where they're at. Sometimes at 6 am, I am firing on all cylinders, I am a little too loud, and then someone will come in clearly not happy to be awake. Being able to rein it in, give them their coffee, be kind, but still short and sweet. They're not looking for anything too intense. But a skill I wish I'd had before going into this was probably being better about taking my days off when I'm taking them because I'm a person who loves to be 100% involved in whatever project I'm in. I get so excited that it's hard for me to take care of myself. I'm also a full-time student online, so incorporating my schedule well has been something I wish I hadn't necessarily had to learn on the job. I didn't know I wasn't as great with time management before I started.

Danielle Davis 6:35
I think any work environment will teach you time management. In a job, you need to create that structure.

Jacob Schekman 6:55
Right. I was curious, what are you studying?

Danielle Davis 6:57
Oh, that's what I was gonna ask.

Rachel Rasmussen 6:59
I am studying nothing related to my career. I am currently finishing my degree in sociology to go on to graduate school for marriage and family therapy.

Danielle Davis 7:11
Okay, sociology has a lot to do with people and what you were talking about, how that's your passion.

Rachel Rasmussen 7:18
Yes, working with others. I realized hospitality was something I was good at. Before I worked at Cat and Cloud, I lived in Amsterdam for a year working at a hostel there. It was also kind of a learn-on-the-job, how-to-do-hospitality thing. I fell in love with it. But I never wanted to study hotel management or hospitality. I was like, "I love what I'm studying in sociology." So it's cool that I have a career I really enjoy right now while I'm on a very long path of school. I enjoy the work I do and feel it's impactful while also maybe looking for another career in the future.

Danielle Davis 7:49
And just expanding on that, knowing that you're going into a completely unrelated field, how do you think your current career is bringing you closer to your goals?

Rachel Rasmussen 8:01
I definitely think it's bringing me to my goals. I learn a lot about people every day and the things that make them tick. One of the things I talk a lot about in sociology and psychology is there's always more under the surface. If someone comes into the cafe and we don't have exactly what they're looking for, and they're upset with us, and they leave angry, most of the time, it has nothing to do with me as a person. That's something cool to think about. Going towards a career as a therapist probably won't necessarily be about me a lot. People are often scared of not being in control. As soon as something happens outside their realm, they might be upset. So that's something I'm learning, how to work with people. I meet hundreds of people every day and I'm learning a more expansive view of people.

Jacob Schekman 8:57
Did you have that mindset before? That's a very mature response.

Rachel Rasmussen 9:17
I did. I started to learn that working in childcare. Kids are honest. I worked at a daycare in high school and nannied off and on throughout the years, especially in college. Sometimes you'll walk in to babysit, and the kid will just look at you and go, "Go away." It doesn't mean they don't like me; they just want their mom. So it's learning not to take offense to that. Working at the hostel, some people would travel for 30 hours and come to the reception desk not in the best mood because they had to walk 15 minutes in the rain with their luggage. That taught me it wasn't about me really quickly.

# INTERACTIONS AND CULTURE

Danielle Davis 10:00
We've kind of touched on this already, but how many people do you usually interact with on a day-to-day basis in your job? How big of a role does interacting with others play in your role as a barista or in human resources?

Rachel Rasmussen 10:20
As a barista, it's one of the biggest things. I'll be working with a team of six or seven people throughout my shift, but we have hundreds of guests coming in the door. Something special about working at a smaller local coffee shop is you start to meet the regulars and know their names. Now it seems like I see a couple hundred friends a day when I work in the cafe. I worked at one of our other cafes for a couple of weeks, and then going back to the one I usually work at, it was like, "Oh, all my friends are here again." As a Human Resources concierge, I meet with a lot of people, but it's more working internally in our company. If someone has a question about their health insurance, holiday time, or how to clock in and out, I'm working more with our team, building that company culture to be stronger.

Danielle Davis 11:15
I have a side question about the company culture. How emphasized is that when you onboard people to the job? Is that something you explicitly tell everyone that you hire?

Rachel Rasmussen 11:32
Definitely. The whole onboarding process is saturated with our culture. When I started working at Cat and Cloud, I had experience in hospitality and working in a coffee shop, but I'd never worked on an espresso machine before. That was less of a priority. The job experience related to the job on a resume is much less important in our interviews than asking what people care about. Another part of my job is looking through resumes and setting up interviews with our team. I'm more focused on how people talk about other people. If someone talks about helping unpleasant customers instead of allowing guests to find exactly what they wanted, I look for how people view other people. We have an orientation before anyone starts shifts, going through a slideshow about how Cat and Cloud began, the process, our mission statement, and how that influences every aspect of the job. It's very important in the orientation.

Jacob Schekman 12:48
For those just tuning in, you're listening to "What to Be" on KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob, and I'm joined by Danielle Davis. We're speaking with Rachel Rasmussen and learning about her career journey in becoming a barista and human resources concierge at Cat and Cloud Coffee. Are there any common misconceptions about being a barista or working in HR?

Danielle Davis 13:18
I feel like that question suits this interview super well, considering just your career path and everything. Could you elaborate on that?

Rachel Rasmussen 13:26
There are so many misconceptions. When I first told my grandmother I got a job at a coffee shop, she was like, "Oh, you're gonna make coffee?" I was so excited about it. Oftentimes in the coffee industry, baristas are not paid well or cared for well. I have a lot of friends who work in coffee who may not be cared for well. But stepping into a space like Cat and Cloud, where full-time employees get four weeks of paid time off a year, access to benefits, and profit sharing. A certain percentage of the coffee and merchandise sales goes back to the employees. There are three original owners and four employee owners. The decisions made by the company are made by the people working in it rather than any sort of investors. The biggest misconception about being a barista is I feel super cared for. I love what I do, and I feel valued as a person, not just for my work. Also, being able to work in the background of a growing company, not just on the floor making coffee, allows me to invest in the company. Back in September, our first cafe had its third birthday. We're a relatively young company.

Jacob Schekman 15:07
How many cafes do you have now?

Rachel Rasmussen 15:09
We currently have three full cafes. We have a location in the county building on Ocean Street, and we are opening a fourth full cafe this month.

Danielle Davis 15:19
One misconception is that coffee or being a barista is an in-between job or part-time job. At Cat and Cloud, the company values people who want to make this their career. Having full-time benefits and knowing you're valued as an employee is revolutionary for a coffee shop. Is it the same at Verve?

Jacob Schekman 15:56
It does sound very similar.

Danielle Davis 16:00
Could you talk a little bit about the owners of Cat and Cloud and why they made this their vision?

Rachel Rasmussen 16:05
Definitely. The three original owners, Jared, Chris, and Charles, started working together at Verve about 12 years ago. Charles had a background on Wall Street and worked with coffee farmers in Sudan. He came down with malaria and had to move home. After recovering, he started working at Verve in finances. They had a passion for coffee and a career in coffee. Chris and Jared believed you didn't need to own a coffee shop to have a career in coffee, which is funny now because they own one. They started a coffee podcast to talk about business and coffee, which led to opening the cafe. The podcast still runs, and the company was built on the vision they wanted for people.

Danielle Davis 17:43
That's really inspiring.

Jacob Schekman 17:45
So Cat and Cloud started from a podcast?

Rachel Rasmussen 17:48
Definitely. The podcast has been going for maybe five years now. It started with the combination of two of the original owners' last names, Truebaca. They gained a following. It's crazy to see the impact a small company makes. We just had two guys who own a coffee shop in London come to Santa Cruz to visit us. They came to Santa Cruz to come to Cat and Cloud and meet us. When people go to work at this cafe called Roslyn in London, one of the questions in their questionnaire is, "What's your favorite coffee shop in the world and why?" Someone applying to work there said Cat and Cloud in Santa Cruz. The podcast puts out a farther reach than one cafe could ever do. It's sweet to see more businesses in coffee caring about the people that work for them.

Jacob Schekman 18:44
To have that impact manifest for someone from London to come to your coffee shop, that's incredible. What kind of hours do you work per week?

Rachel Rasmussen 18:56
I work a little less than full-time, around 35 hours a week. About 10 to 15 hours in HR and the rest in the cafe. I love the flexibility in my schedule. Growing up, I thought a career meant settling down, sucking it up, and going to the same job every day. But seeing flexible hours and a supportive environment makes me question that model. Tomorrow I work at 5:30 am but get off in the middle of the day and can do other things. We try not to have too many full eight-hour shifts, so people still have time for other things in their life. Full eight-hour shifts are available for those who want them.

Jacob Schekman 20:17
Awesome. We're going to step away for a quick break and remind those just tuning in that you're listening to "What to Be" at KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob, and I'm joined by Danielle. We're speaking with Rachel Rasmussen and learning about her journey to becoming a barista and human resources concierge at Cat and Cloud Coffee.

# CAREER PATH AND GROWTH

Danielle Davis 20:55
You started as a barista before in a different coffee shop. How has your career changed since you first began, and what are some cultural changes in the industry?

Rachel Rasmussen 21:11
I viewed it as an in-between job because I didn't want to stay in Santa Cruz. I grew up here, moved away for a couple of years, and then came back for family reasons. Working at Cat and Cloud changed my mindset. Now, it's hard to imagine moving away because I'm excited about work every day and learning so much. I feel cared for, which is rare in the coffee business. We don't hire employees seasonally; we hire with the attitude of wanting people to stay with us. My perspective on growing and learning in the company has changed, and now I want to keep working here.

Danielle Davis 22:22
Have you ever had to make any difficult career decisions?

Rachel Rasmussen 22:25
I don't think I've had too many difficult career decisions yet. I'm sure those are coming. I don't want to live in Santa Cruz forever, so my career might shift if I move. But I've been surprised by how much I enjoy it and love working with the people here.

Danielle Davis 22:47
When you interviewed with Cat and Cloud, did you view it as a temporary job, or did that change on the job?

Rachel Rasmussen 23:03
I interviewed at an interesting time. While working at a hostel in Amsterdam, I became connected with a network of hospitality around the world. The week I interviewed for Cat and Cloud, I had just turned down a job in Mexico City to manage a hostel. I decided to stay in Santa Cruz and thought, "If I'm here, I'd love to interview." I didn't have a timeline planned, but I didn't think I would be here for as long as I have been. That changed on the job.

Jacob Schekman 23:49
Is there anything you wish you knew about this job before coming into it?

Rachel Rasmussen 23:54
For Human Resources concierge, I feel blessed to be well-trained. I had zero experience in human resources going into this job, and I am being trained well. As a barista, I wish I'd known you will stain all of your clothing and can never have your nails painted. You have to wear your hair up. On the days I'm not behind the counter, I can wear white, open-toed shoes, and have my hair down. Half of my wardrobe I can't wear at work.

Jacob Schekman 24:43
Yeah, it's risky business if you're trying to dress nice and be a barista at the same time.

Rachel Rasmussen 24:46
Oh yeah, I have some co-workers who do it and must love Tide pens or something. I don't have enough energy for laundry.

# PROJECTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Danielle Davis 24:53
Have there been any projects you've worked on at Cat and Cloud, and how did you enjoy them?

Rachel Rasmussen 25:02
Definitely. When I was an executive assistant to one of the owners, Jared, back in April, May, and June, I was part of opening our Aptos cafe in June. I went to one of our current cafes, watched everything employees touched, and made a list of everything needed for the new cafe. It felt like a crazy puzzle to ensure we had everything. Since June, I've seen the team take ownership of the space and make it their own. It's been so fun to help open a cafe and see it come alive with people enjoying it.

Danielle Davis 26:48
That project sounds like it opened your eyes to the technicalities and nuances of a coffee shop.

Rachel Rasmussen 27:08
It absolutely did.

Jacob Schekman 27:08
I've got one last question for you. You're a student with two interesting jobs. What advice do you have for high school students about to graduate and head into college, many of whom will need to get a job while studying?

Rachel Rasmussen 27:35
I think being a student is lovely. I went to school in Seattle for a while and am now finishing my studies online, which is a different dynamic. School is important, but it takes a lot of time. If you're going to school and working, and also trying to work out, eat, shower, do laundry, I advise you to have a job you enjoy. It's okay not to put pressure on yourself to have a job that furthers your career immediately. Value your well-being emotionally, and having a job you enjoy will help with that.
