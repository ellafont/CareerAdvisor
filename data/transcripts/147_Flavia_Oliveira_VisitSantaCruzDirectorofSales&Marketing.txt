#Introduction

Flavia Oliveira  01:20
absolutely. I started my journey in Brazil. I've always been fascinated about the travel industry. So I did get a bachelor's degree in tourism management. And then during college times, I just really fell in love a lot of the hospitality. So after graduating from a bachelor degree in Brazil, I moved to Switzerland to do a master in hotel management. And one thing kind of led to another on my hospitality journey, and I did join Marriott as an intern, and then as a front desk in front of the house. And then, like 20 years ago, I did get my first sales job, also with Marriott International. And I really found myself on that department, I was just very passionate about just curating and bringing more businesses to the hotels that I used to represent. I did move a lot. So I did have experience in many different markets, including international and then I landed in San Francisco Bay Area about seven years ago, still with Marriott. And then I had the opportunity to try a an industry that goes side by side with that, which is what we call the destination marketing office. DMO which is visit Santa Cruz County where I work right now. So visit Santa Cruz County, we are the official visitor marketing entity for Santa Cruz County. We are a private nonprofit corporation. So it's not a government job as a lot of people think just because of the name. And we are here to work to enhance tourism, the visitor experience in the area economy by positioning and promoting Santa Cruz County as a year round visitor conference and film destination.

Interviewer  03:30
That's awesome. Flavia, thank you for sharing that. Your education journey is so interesting too, how was it going from Brazil to Switzerland, where you earned your master's degree.

Flavia Oliveira  03:44
Yes. it was quite a journey. I do say that was the year that changed my life. I did have a whole year to prepare at the point I needed to get a proficiency test in English. So after I graduated, I took like a year that I was actually working full time at a hotel and just really sharpened up my English, going through the application process. Doing a lot of translations submitting a lot of documentation. But the program is for hospitality in Switzerland is one of the best in the world. All the  Swiss schools are highly recognizable. So I just had the dream and I did have the support of my family to really help me get into the program. And then I did so it was quite a journey. I did a flight to Switzerland. It was a New Year's Eve. Nothing happened on the plane when it turned midnight. I was expecting something but not a lot happening there. And then I just landed there going from Brazil to mid winter of Switzerland and it was pretty magical. Once I got there, It wasn't International School. So once I got there, I just found a lot of people that were on the same boat as I was. A lot of them having this international experience for the first time. And kind of, you know, trying to find your friends in an environment that nobody knew each other. But I think that because we are all in the same boat, we create very strong friendships, some of that I have till today. Because we're all supporting each other. So it was super magical. It was also the first time that I decided to get a whole degree on my second language. Yeah, it was a lot of learning. It's definitely a lot of learning.

Interviewer  05:48
I bet. Did you live in dorms when you were there? And did you travel? Did you travel with anyone else from your school? Were there other Brazilians? 

Flavia Oliveira  05:57
No, I traveled by myself. There were other Brazilians that I just met when they got there. Yeah, but we did not know each other before.

Interviewer  06:07
Okay. Yeah, I can imagine that must have been maybe a culture shock in some ways. And you know, the winter too, getting used to that coming from such a warm climate. And then you went on to work in London for Marriott? 

Flavia Oliveira  06:22
I did, yes. So once you first graduate, you become eligible for certain internship programs abroad. One of those that I don't know if anybody would recognize here, is called the J-1 program.  Which is a visa that you can get, and then you become eligible to work for a period of time abroad. So J-1 is a program in the US. So after Switzerland, the school actually helped you with a program in the US or Australia. And then I chose to come to the US. And they helped me with the entire application and even  relocation to the US at that point. And so that's when I joined Marriott International as an intern, because they, they really support the type of internship. And then it was for one year in Colorado, and it was amazing. But then when my visa renow, I moved to London. And then I was in London for about four years. And the first couple of years, I was still working all the operations positions than you can imagine, at a hotel. And then in 2011, I moved to sales. And then the way that the Marriott is set up, for the manage properties they do have those clusters of sales teams that represent multiple hotels. So when I was there, I was selling, I think it about 16 hotels that were my primary market. And then as a secondary market, it was about 30. Once they moved to the US, because they have more inventory here then the market was a little larger. It was in the mid atlantic group sales office that covered all the hotels from Maryland to North Carolina. And then moving to the Bay Area. Then I was in the San Francisco cluster, which cover hotels from Monterrey to Sonoma.

Interviewer  08:26
Okay. And did you work for visit in Oakland as well?

Flavia Oliveira  08:32
Yes. So that was my first experience at a destination marketing office. It was working for visit Oakland. So I did this movie about 2017. And then I really fell in love with what those DMOS actually do. Because it is, it just like opened up my mind a lot on how tourism impacts the local economy. Once I was at a hotel, even though I was in sales, I was always very focused on what was happening for that one property per se, but looking how tourism  really can drive a local economy. It's very fascinating. So once we are talking to meeting planners and trying to bring their conferences to the destination, you can really see how that impacts not only the hotel who's hosting this conference, but all the local restaurants, all the local retail shops, even how he helps your local airports because of the increase on air traffic due to the compression that you are causing, and transportation so everybody wins. And it was very rewarding to be on an environment like that.

Interviewer  09:50
Okay, very cool. And so how long have you been on visit Santa Cruz?

Flavia Oliveira  09:56
Visit Santa Cruz has been 10 months

Interviewer  09:59
And So you Why did you I guess, move to the Santa Cruz area? Was it for working for this organization here.

Flavia Oliveira  10:08
It was actually, to merge my professional and personal life together. My husband has been in Santa Cruz for 20 years. And when we met, I was in Oakland, and he was here. So it was that kind of story. And we were commuting, seeing kind of alternating weekends, he will come to the East Bay one weekend, I will come to Santa Cruz the following one. And he just came to a point that we both preferred Santa Cruz over the East Bay, and then I just had the job opportunity to make the move. Nice.

Unknown Speaker  10:40
#Worklife 

Unknown Speaker  10:40
Very cool. Do you want to share with us some of like what your typical day to day work week looks like?

Flavia Oliveira  10:47
Absolutely, it's, it's every day's a little different. Because we pretty much the way that we work, we're we are not a reactive type of organization, we are very proactive. So we pretty much layout our entire year ahead of us. So, for example, we are always working with our CES analogies, and then having certain campaigns that we're going to put it together, but we're always a quarter behind when things needed to actualize. So we're always like writing content, creating content, reaching out to our stakeholders, who are our hotels, to create any content that we can to promote the destination. Me on the sales side of things. I talk a lot with meeting planners, and I also attend trade shows. So I am promoting Santa Cruz as a conference destination. So I do have on a daily basis, those contacts with meeting planners receiving RFPs, which are requests for proposals, which is them giving me the requirements that they need for a conference to happen. And then I'll go back to them with suggestions on hotels that are suitable, and how they can happen in Santa Cruz. And then being the middle person communicating between meeting planner and hotel. And there, there's also a portion that we do, which is co-ops. So some of our marketing initiatives, they are open for paid partnership. And that's something that falls under my umbrella as well. So for example, right now, if you follow us on social media, you will see that there is a big sweepstakes going on and the call for action is enter to win. So I did all those coops in the end of last year for a campaign that's running this year.

Interviewer  12:44
Okay, and so, so it sounds like you're working from your office a lot. And then maybe you have to get some presentations to.

Flavia Oliveira  12:54
Yeah, it is a big mix of both.

Unknown Speaker  12:57
Yeah, very cool. And, you know, do you want to talk about maybe some of some of the skills that you use in your day to day job and how might you acquire these skills?

Flavia Oliveira  13:07
Yeah, I would say that organization is something major for me. Because under my umbrella, there are many subcategories. Let's put it that way that I needed to be constantly keeping an eye on and updating in however I'm organizing myself being organized is a must on this position. And high communication as well.  Do you want to share with us some of your more favorite projects that you've worked on in your career? Yes, I think that the spring campaign that we are running right now, it's been a very fun one. So the spring campaign, my capacity on the project was selling the coops for some of the partners, but that is a project that we tag TV ads, we tag printed ads, and social media ads for 12 weeks. And so there's a lot of creatives that go behind to that. And it's very fascinating to work with the team that we do to get all those creatives going. So a lot of photography and a lot of messaging and collars, because everything needs to catch people's eyes on a way that make them want to visit Santa Cruz, and also feel inspired about the destination. So that is a very fun one, which then we we kind of collaborated, myself and the creative team, we collaborated, because we had a second project going side by side with the content creation, which is for the international market, which is something that visit Santa Cruz County has never done before. So we we actually bought into a co op at that point with branch USA. And we targeted our biggest international markets, which are the UK, Germany, Canada and Australia. And then we did remarketing with Sojourn. And then we also did marketing with Expedia, but only for the international market. And it was just very, very fun to be working on those creatives. And we have those creatives kind of working on both the spring campaign and the International. It's very easy in a way to do this with Visit Santa Cruz Because Santa Cruz County is so beautiful. And there's so much diversity with the redwoods and the ocean and the agriculture and the highway one. So for us to generate content, everything is very dreamy.

Interviewer  16:57
#Covid 19 Fabia I was thinking was, was a difficult last couple years with everything going on.

Flavia Oliveira  17:18
It was a roller coaster, for sure. So  with COVID-19, it really hit the tourism industry really hard in the beginning. And we did see all the hotel occupancy just drop, and a lot of people getting laid off. And then what made it a little bit more difficult, especially emotionally for Santa Cruz during COVID was the wildfires. So August 28 when everybody had a mandatory evacuation there were about 77,000 families that had to evacuate from Santa Cruz Mountains. And we did see the hoteliers of the tourism industry really get together and open up the doors to accommodate and house all those families that are being relocated. So it was a roller coaster of emotions in there. Because we did have hotels with single digits, occupancy, going to 100% occupancy in about 20 minutes, with very, very limited staff at that point. Because people were all laid off that in a way saved or captured the hotels afloat for a while. It helped then the economy on the tourism industry itself. But it was just very difficult. I was at that point working at a property here in Santa Cruz. I was a hotel paradox. So I was part of checking those people in and hearing their stories. So it was very beautiful, though, to be able to have a safe place for them to go to. And it was very emotional for sure. But that just shows how how this industry can be much more than just tourists.

Unknown Speaker  19:27
Yeah, the people who live here seem like they're very dedicated to supporting our community, which I think is like you said, beautiful.

Flavia Oliveira  19:35
That is very true. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  19:37
Did the hotels help provide vouchers to people who might need some help?

Flavia Oliveira  19:44
So there is a third party that gets involved with the hotel so the vouchers did not were not issued by the hotel, per se. But it was from the insurance company so they were just issuing the vouchers and then for hotel paradox, for example, those vouchers were not even like a paper voucher, they were just making the reservations. And then they were just paying for the rooms. And that was what the voucher became. So it was a lot of explaining for people, because there was, once you are in an emergency situation, the communication gets a little funky. So sometimes we will get people come to the hotel, saying, Hey, I'm here. My insurance told me to come here. And it was like, oh, yeah, we have your reservation. And your reservation is for a week and you're like, but I don't understand why it's a week. I don't know how long I'm going to be here for. But they were releasing those authorizations, week by week. So it was a little challenging to manage. I think for the hotels that have never had an emergency situation. It was also a big learning opportunity. But we went through it and we got through it. And I'm happy that we could help so many people.

Unknown Speaker  21:07
#Personality

Unknown Speaker  21:07
That's great. And yeah, I would imagine that it would be confusing with a lot of moving parts or other unknowns. I love what you said about using it as a learning opportunity. Flavia, what kind of person you think would enjoy you the line of work that you ran?

Flavia Oliveira  21:27
It needs to be someone who loves people. And loves to meet new people, and someone who embraces all sorts of cultures, and someone who embraces diversity, and someone who really wants to make people have a good time. It is the industry of serving right. So once you are in the tourism, you just really want people to come to your destination, or your hotel or your venue and just really have a good time. So it is a very heavy industry with people that have very high standards. 

Interviewer  22:13
 Do you go back to Brazil often?

Flavia Oliveira  22:15
I do go every year. Of course, I didn't go in 2020. In 2021, actually, but I did go back in February 2020. To see my family after a long time.

Interviewer  22:30
That's so great. Yeah, I think I saw a news article that said they did Carnival for the first time in a couple years.

Flavia Oliveira  22:38
Yeah. And that was huge. Because for Brazilians to not have their carnival. It's a big deal.

Interviewer  22:43
Yeah. And that's probably a huge tourism destination, right globally? 

Flavia Oliveira  22:47
yes, it is. It is. Absolutely. It brings a lot of tourists. It is a it's a very unique celebration. Because I know there are other countries they do celebrate carnival, but not the way that Brazilians do. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  23:03
I mean, every from everything I've heard, but I've seen it looks like an amazing experience.

Flavia Oliveira  23:08
It is an amazing experience. A lot of happy people a lot of dancing. And a great great time.

Interviewer  23:16
Very cool. Yeah. Visually, it looks just Stunning. Stunning.

Flavia Oliveira  23:18
Yeah. With all the costumes and the colors.

Unknown Speaker  23:21
Yeah. So great. Flavia what's your favorite part or most rewarding part of your job?

Flavia Oliveira  23:29
Oh, that's a good question. I think it is when you hear people raving about how beautiful Santa Cruz is and how great a time they had here. And I love when I hear people exploring the entire county. And not just seeing Santa Cruz as only the beach or the boardwalk, which is so iconic. But really it's like expanding this idea of Santa Cruz as the redwoods and you know, all the redwood forests that we have in that agriculture that we have. And the wineries. I think that's very rewarding for us.

Interviewer  24:11
And more than just the Redwoods in the ocean. I mean, within four hours, you can be in the snow, you can be in the desert. So you really can be in all these different environments. 

Flavia Oliveira  24:21
Yeah, we are very lucky here.

Unknown Speaker  24:23
#Advice

Interviewer  24:23
It's very true. Yeah. Flavia, what kind of advice or resources can you provide to students who are interested in pursuing a career, you know, in line with what you do?

Flavia Oliveira  24:36
I would say be tenacious, go get it. Apply for a lot of positions. I know that there are a lot of positions that are open really use LinkedIn. I am a huge LinkedIn fan. And I feel that it is very, very strong in the tourism industry and hospitality. Don't be afraid of calling someone if you want some advice. Really just go call someone see what their experience is. And one thing that I found very beneficial for me that I really wish I had done before was find a mentor. And that person does not really necessarily need to be in the industry that you were very interested in. But just just find someone that you can always call just to put your thoughts straight and just make you keep going. And I found this person for me, she's my former boss as well. And I don't even know if she understands that she's my mentor, but it's just someone that really helps you understand what your next step is. And once you are ready for your next step, go take it. 

Interviewer  25:47
That's great advice. Thank you for sharing that. And yeah, hopefully, when you were studying abroad, that you had people that you could ask for advice and reach out to our for resources.

Flavia Oliveira  25:55
Absolutely. Yeah. Well, my school level that we even had a department for that that was just really supporting all these students, finding an internship, finding their next step what they want to do next. But I feel that once you're out of the school environment, you lose that. And you don't have to necessarily lose that. You just need to find who that person is for you.

Unknown Speaker  26:17
That's great. Yeah, and I agree with that. Flavia, what about advice for someone who is unsure about their career path?

Flavia Oliveira  26:25
That is a very good one. I think that just see what you're passionate about. Because I feel that your job needs to be something that you enjoy, and you love, and you feel proud that you're doing it. And I will say, try that. It's never too late to change careers, it is never too late to go back to school. So if you find a job, and you think you want a career, and maybe in a year or two, you realize that that's not fulfilling you, then you just try something else. I think that we are asked to choose a career very early in life, when we're still trying to find who we are imagining what we like and what we're actually passionate about. And I feel that I did change my career. Even though I'm in the same industry, I was so focused in being at a hotel and I want to be working for a hotel. And at some point in my life, I'm like, I want to be a general manager of a hotel. I was so sure about that. And, just working through the hotel, I realized that operations was not my passion. So I moved to sales. And then I figured out the sales was way more my passion, but then I figured out that there is this other thing that's beautiful. That's what I do right now on the DMO capacity. So it's just never too late. But keep your eyes open. Keep your ears open, but really try to find something that you're passionate about. 

Unknown Speaker  27:54
that's great advice. Flavia, thank you much for sharing that. You know, I think being Yeah, like you said, being adaptable, and  learning on the job and just kind of figuring out like fine tuning really what you want to do, through life. Perfect. Yeah. Thank you so much. And Flavia. I just want to thank you again, for being such an inspiring guest on our show this evening. I really appreciate you taking your time.
