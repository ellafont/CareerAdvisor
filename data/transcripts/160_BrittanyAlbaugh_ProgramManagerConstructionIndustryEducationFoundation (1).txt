Interviewer  0:18  
Hello and welcome everyone to KS QD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Harte and you're listening to our show want to be where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What to me is a program provided by your futures our business, the Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, panels, and other work based learning activities.

The information provided during this program does not reflect his career in this career in its entirety. And today, I have the pleasure to speak to Brittany Albaugh , who's the program manager for the construction industry Education Foundation. Hi, Brittany. 


Brittany Albaugh  1:09  
Hello. Thank you so much, Patrick, for having me today, good to be here. 
# Career Journey
Interviewer  1:15  
Thank you very much. Yeah. And I really appreciate you taking the time to, to join us on Fourth of July weekend. And yes, I'm very grateful for you to be here. And Brittany, I was wondering, can you briefly describe your career journey for us?


Brittany Albaugh  1:29  
Yeah, absolutely. So I graduated high school in 2004. And went to Chico State and I earned my teaching credential, and a minor in psychology. And then I went into actually it was 2008, when times were now starting to enter into a recession. And there were far fewer teaching jobs available. So I started aiding in a classroom, a special education classroom and an elementary school. And the teacher really pushed me to kind of follow that path. I loved it. I loved working with that population of students. So I decided to transition to a different pathway than I had imagined. And became a special education teacher and earned my special ed teaching credential while teaching full time and taught special education for eight years. And then I decided I wanted to continue to help students in a different non-traditional way, then teaching and kind of venture outside of the classroom whenI had a friend asked me if I wanted to support writing some curriculum for the building and construction trades path and intern in the nonprofit world. And so I did that curriculum base, worked and expanded the program for a few years, and then became an executive director with the construction industry Education Foundation, Jordan player. I was, you know, working in partnership with that other nonprofit and he reached out and said, Hey, I heard you want to move to Texas, we're looking to expand our programs nationally, would you be open to doing that? So I came over to the construction industry Education Foundation, where I am now I'm a program manager. And we connect high school career technical education students to industry in the built environment, we provide programs for kids to explore all the opportunities within the built environment, career exploration, they call trades Day event, and then our create mentoring program. And then our design goal competition for students to design and build a structure for a local community organization or nonprofit in a two day competition, so I currently am loving it. We are expanding our program across California and then nationally just moved to Texas to bring our programs to both Dallas and Houston. 


Interviewer  4:36  
Well, congratulations on your move and, and also just on your career journey I know what you're doing, you know what you've done. It's so beautiful and just very meaningful. And working with you know, special education and then now transferring to construction, education. And I guess what I was wondering, one of the questions is, did you have a background in construction you know at all before moving in this direction?


Brittany Albaugh  5:03  
That is a very good question. And it absolutely not. My father, my father was a manager for a roofing Supply Company, and roofing like ran in our family, but I knew nothing about it. And I still I'm learning so much along the way. My colleagues and I always joke like, when we are writing the curriculum or editing the Instructor Guide, like, oh, that's something new we learned, because it's just, you know, never in whole worlds, but I have guessed, I would be in this industry. But it's such an amazing industry. And, you know, there's so many opportunities for kids within the industry that, you know, they can explore and the it's such a lucrative industry as well. Lots of opportunities. So, no, to your the answer to your question is no, but I'm able to learn along the way. And I think that that's, you know, the beautiful thing of having an open mind and just kind of diving in and being open to learning new things throughout your professional career. You know, it's important.


Interviewer  6:23  
 Yeah. And also, I can imagine that switching, you know, directions, I guess, in your education, in like profession, keeping it very fresh, must be kind of fun for you because you're learning all this new stuff, maybe like every day, and that just must keep it very interesting.


Brittany Albaugh  6:45  
Absolutely. And I think like, why I like this particular nonprofit realm, and what I'm doing is I'm still able to connect with the students, and still able to help the students. And that's always been, like, my passion, like when I really think about what it is that I want to do in my life, is to help youth and help youth that maybe needs assistance with their direction. And that's what I was doing as a special education teacher. And that's what I'm currently doing.


# Career Paths
Interviewer  7:17  
Yeah, that's great. You know, because I remember, like, when I was younger, and I think many of us, when we're in school, we don't we have no idea in which direction to go. And a lot of the time, you know, we find that out later, and maybe maybe even after school, but you know, some people with a trade like construction, people learn at a young age, maybe that, hey, this is very interesting. I like creating things and building in, I think it's really great and important to have the, you know, the opportunity is there for students at a young age to have programs like this, to help guide them in a more maybe, like direct or, you know what I mean? Like a more direct path, I guess, to keep them focused on school. So then they don't feel like hey, what's the point, I don't care about school, if they find something they're passionate about, this makes it easier for them to kind of stay with that, like, in that like focus or with that focus.


Brittany Albaugh  8:12  
Yeah, and that's what I was finding as a special education teacher, is my students were feeling so much success in their woodworking course, they would come in so happy and proud of what they built with their hands, because they weren't being asked to sit in a traditional classroom and take a pencil paper test, or read a book and answer questions, they were able to show their skills through by doing and hands on experience. And I just think that that's so valuable in such an important aspect of our education system today to offer to students as a pathway that they can take, and maybe maybe they don't go that pathway, but at least they're able to explore it and show and have that light we like to say at our design build competition that we do in the spring that that is their two days that they are able to show their knowledge show what they're made of show their hard work, just like all the other football players are able to do under the like, every Friday night.


Interviewer  9:27  
And you know, like you're saying like, maybe they won't stay within that. Like on that path maybe of construction, but maybe they'll work construction through school and then decide like, hey, I want to like go further with this and maybe move into like, engineering or something along those lines. And also what I was thinking when you were talking about, you know, keeping the kids focuses, like with construction like you do need to know math and instead of like, giving them in a traditional classroom setting like hey, we got to figure out all this stuff, all this all this math work, and there's no motivation behind it. But if they're, if they're doing construction, and then they see the need to learn, you know, math, then there might be more motivation for them to do it, right? 


Brittany Albaugh  10:11
Absolutely. We call it real world applicable, like the engagement is higher, because students are able to understand why they're learning the fractions like, what am I going to? I heard this so much in class, like, how am I ever going to use this in the future, but when they're actually able to apply it in class and see the real world application, it's so much more valuable for our students. Yeah. And also, I want to make another point to your point of not necessarily staying on the pathway, you know, after high school, but we also remember that we all are going to live in an apartment or a home, you know, wherever we live, we're going to need to know those skills on how to fix things, right? Instead of having to call a plumber over to fix our toilet. We might already know that from these classes that you're learning in high school. So I think that the value of them is just real world knowledge that can carry on with the students throughout the rest of their life.


Interviewer  11:17
Yeah, and I can imagine that on top of just instilling competence, like how rewarding is it to like, have a problem and be able to figure it out yourself? Right


Brittany Albaugh  11:27  
right. Yeah. Oh, my gosh, and to save money


Interviewer  11:31  
and not having to turn to YouTube. Although YouTube's very helpful for a lot of different things.


Brittany Albaugh  11:36  
It's a great resource


# Job Responsibilities
Interviewer  11:39  
Brittany, do you want to talk? I mean, I'm sure you do a lot. But you want to you want to share with us just some of like, your main duties and responsibilities, kind of? Yeah, like in your day to day?


Brittany Albaugh  11:50  
Yeah. Basically, I work with connecting students, primarily high school students to industry. Our tagline is where industry is the classroom. So we really are just trying to get industry into the classroom or job site visits, and get students connected so that they can explore the different avenues within the industry, the building the built environment, and get a feel for the Yeah, the various opportunities. I work, like I said, both with schools and industry, and it's a lot of just building relationships, putting on events. So like I mentioned, the trade stay event and the design build competition are the two workforce development events that I put on. And we have several trades day events that are across California, and then some that are launching here in Texas. So just a lot of moving parts, but primarily our overall focus is getting kids connected to the industry.


Interviewer  13:05  
Yeah, that's great. So are you how much time would you say you spend in a classroom like, like a traditional classroom setting?


Brittany Albaugh  13:14  
So I don't necessarily go in that often. I would love to be able to visit do classroom visits more often. But a lot of my time is not in the classroom anymore.


Interviewer  13:31  
Okay, so are you guys like, you know, I just think of like my woodshop class in high school. And I was telling you that, you know, I graduated SoCal high here in santa cruz A while ago, and my woodshop teacher is still there. He's a CTE teacher, his name is Les probic. And he was he's awesome. And he was a guest on the show. So is that like, where you work? Like in a in a woodshop type setting?


Brittany Albaugh  13:55  
Me in the past, or now?


Interviewer  13:57  
I guess. Yeah. Like now? No, no, no. So


Brittany Albaugh  14:02  
Oh, my gosh, I couldn't imagine myself operating those tools. I'll leave it to the professional to do that. No, I so currently. So in Sacramento, we have our headquarters and I work in an office with our other colleagues. But what I do is I work with like the, I would work with your woodshop teacher at SoCal High School, to get industry into the classroom through guest speaking opportunities to field trip, you know, field trips for the students, etc. And so I currently am working remote and I have a community workspace that I go into a couple days a week. So not in a classroom. 


Interviewer  14:50  
Okay. Yeah, I guess I wasn't I didn't think that you were like maybe every day I wasn't sure if how often maybe you went, went in there. And then you know what kind of skills would you say you use in your career? And? And you know, this current career? And would you? How would you say you acquired these skills?


Brittany Albaugh  15:08  
Yeah, I mean, I feel like every job and every professional experience that I've had has helped me get to this point. You know, we all constantly are evolving and using new skills. And so a lot of the skills that I use currently heavy on communication skills, teamwork, perseverance, hard work is a big one. And just continuing to be open minded and grow and learn from mistakes or learn from, you know, I'm a big reflector. At the end of the day, I like to reflect on my day and maybe process how it could have done had a conversation differently or how I could have approached something differently and then work on it the next time. So I think it's, you know, as we all step into the professional world, I think it's important to reflect and to constantly allow yourself to evolve and grow with the skills that you use. Yeah,


Interviewer  16:25  
agreed. That's beautiful. Thank you for sharing that. And for all those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the what to be show on KSK at Santa Cruz, 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Harte, and I'm speaking with Brittany Alba, who's the program director for the construction industry Education Foundation. Brittany, I wanted to ask you, you've done a lot in your career, what would you say maybe some of your favorite projects that you've worked on, or maybe are currently working on.


Brittany Albaugh  16:53  
So our design build competition is probably one of my favorite projects that I have worked on for students. It is a two day. So it's actually a four month long program, where students, it's a team. So it's a building construction trades pathway could be engineering pathway, architecture, pathway, building instruction pathway, we've had some theater, kids pathway, you know, come out and do it as well. But it's a four month long program where they identify an end user in their community for that needs a structure. And then they design the structure. And we pair them with architectural mentors that come in and help them with the design phase. And then we connect them with industry along the way they come out. We provide all the materials for them to build their structure in two days. And we have industry professionals walking around helping judge them. We've had business cards handed out for hire mint, or hiring for employment. And for internships, we award scholarships. It's just I leave every design goal competition, so pumped up for our future in the industry, because these kids are out there just working so hard, and are determined to complete their structure. And it just makes me so happy to see them getting hired by industry. They're right on the spot. Yeah,


Interviewer  18:33  
that's very cool. And can you share with us like what kind of stuff are they building for the competition?


Brittany Albaugh  18:37  
Yeah, that's good question. So we've had greenhouses. We've had tiny homes for homeless veterans. We've had some place structures for local childcare facilities, some storage sheds. We had an all girls team, which was awesome this year. So it's just it can be as creative we had a like a helicopter for a local childcare facility as well. So can be super as creative as they wish or it can just be, you know, a 96 square foot shed that is donated to someone that needs a storage shed like I do in my backyard.


# This line of work
Interviewer  19:23  
Beautiful. So yeah, you can maybe give them some suggestions depending on what the helicopter sounds interesting. I can only imagine. Very, yes. Wow. Kids are very talented. And yeah, and what kind of person would you say would enjoy the line of work that you're in?


Brittany Albaugh  19:44  
Um, I think it takes a very passionate person who is flexible and able to work in a team has very strong communication skills and can, you know, build strong relationships. And just, like I said, very passionate to help the youth, and not only the youth, but this is also helping the industry, the building and construction industry is on a, you know, job shortage because of all the retirement. Everyone's retiring, we had a ton of years, like my era, where no one went into the trades, we all were pushed to go to college, college, college. And so we have a labor labor gap. And so we are just really needing workers. So I think that, you know, someone, an individual who is passionate to help both sides, the industry and the students inter, you know, and find their passion. 


Interviewer  20:57  
Yeah, that's great. And, you know, in why is your job important to you and or to society? I think you shared a little bit on that. But if you don't mind elaborating more, yeah,


Brittany Albaugh  21:07  
so like I mentioned, I was feeling like a lot of my special education, kids and students who maybe aren't college bound, or doesn't have the money or needs to support their family right away. They just, were not given a lot of opportunities. And I think we're still in a situation that they are needing to be educated more on the various opportunities that are out there for them. And so it's such a rewarding and fulfilling job for me, that I'm able to provide those opportunities for not just this, you know, population of students that I'm referring to these opportunities are for everyone. But that is the population that's really near and dear to my heart, coming from a special education, teaching background. And so I feel like I'm able to help them kind of get a sense of identity and a purpose. And, you know, what's next for them after high school? ,


# Switching Careers
Interviewer  22:20  
yeah. And I can only imagine, was there like a little bit of nerves for you, you know, when you're switching Career Directions?


Brittany Albaugh  22:28  
That's a very good question. So I actually quit my teaching job without a plan. I didn't know what I was going to do next. I did not have a job lined up my boyfriend at the time, which is now my husband thought I was crazy.


Interviewer  22:49  
Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah.


Brittany Albaugh  22:53  
Yeah, it was fearful and scary. But, you know, I want to and I feel like the listeners, you know, should hear this, that sometimes taking that leap of faith and opening up a whole avenue of unknowns brings, and allows you to connect to what is like, purposeful for you, and what is like your Dustin like path. And so I feel like doing that allowed me to really connect with, you know, this position and bring opportunities that like I said earlier, I had no idea in my wildest dreams that I would be in the construction industry. But that's I think why that happened in this position landed in my lap, because I, you know, went towards that fear and went towards that unknown and allowed the inevitable to come to me.


Interviewer  23:56  
Yeah. And would you say that that's, like, where growth happens with people's putting themselves in uncomfortable situations? 


Brittany Albaugh  24:04  
Absolutely, Patrick, I mean, if we stay stagnant, and in our comfort zones for the rest of our lives, like it's minimal growth, so you got to put yourself out there and you got to, you know, push yourself out of your comfort zone and explore the unknowns so that you are able to grow and be okay with falling at times. Like it's not going to be an easy path. And it's, well, likely not going to be an easy path. But that's okay. That's like the beauty of our life is the ebb and flow and allowing, you know, the growth to happen.


Interviewer  24:44  
Yeah, that's great. And did you have people that when you were making these big decisions that you could bounce stuff off or, or maybe even like a mentor?


Brittany Albaugh  24:55  
Actually, I have had a few mentors Throughout my career, absolutely, I actually did mentor several teachers, myself, and one of the jobs as like a bridge to the current jobs that in the nonprofit world was mentor new teachers. Because I felt like having a mentor and being a mentor is such an important thing in our lives, to help keep us grounded and balanced, and, you know, remind us that it's not going to be a, you know, straight, straight path. So I highly suggest any listeners, if you don't have a mentor, get a mentor. It's very important to have along the way, and it may not be the same mentor throughout your whole professional or personal life, it's okay to change along the way for your needs certain needs that you have at that time. 


Interviewer  25:55  
Yeah, thank you for sharing that. And I totally agree with you. Having someone is like a mentor is such a for me, you know, it's such a, I'm so grateful to have that person, you know, to share, like wisdom, like life experience.


Brittany Albaugh  26:11  
Absolutely. Absolutely. Doing trying to do it all on your own is never an easy task. 


Interviewer  26:17  
Yes, asking for help, you know, or asking questions. I know that sometimes the ego can get in the way of those things. But I think that we might be cutting ourselves short. If we don't, yeah.


Brittany Albaugh  26:29  
The asking for help, and is something I have to work on all the time.


Interviewer  26:35  
You and me both it's getting easier, though. It's getting easier, the more I do it, you know? And then, and then I'm realizing that by me asking for help, I'm helping that person to have to remember I have to remind myself that, yeah, 


Brittany Albaugh  26:51  
it's so true. We always think just like what the experience is giving us, but it's also giving everyone involved an experience. It's, you know


Interviewer  27:01  
the ripple effect, you know, yeah, yeah. I'm a believer in it. Brittany, what kind of advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career and in line with what you with your work?


Brittany Albaugh  27:15  
Yeah, I think so for if you're interested in the building and construction trades industry, I think it's important for you to, you know, of course, you're welcome to reach out to me, I would be happy to connect you with any industry that you, you know, may want to be connected to. But I think any line of work, I think it's important to just be open and try it. You don't have to stay in the same position for your whole career, there's going to be other opportunities that pop up for you that you may be able to try. So I think, just giving it a shot, seeing if you like it, and if you don't, that's okay, too, you at least know that you don't like it. So my big takeaway is give it a shot. 


Interviewer  28:13  
Yeah. And you know, worked out for you, you changed careers, you know, you took a big shot, and it seems like it's working out very well for you. 


Brittany Albaugh  28:19  
Yeah, absolutely. 


# Career Path Uncertainty
Interviewer  28:21  
Yeah. And Brittany, what about advice for someone who is unsure about their career path? 


Brittany Albaugh  28:26  
That's okay. It's totally fine. If you are not sure on what you want to do with your career. Like I, you know, my same kind of advice that I just shared with you is just give something a shot, just dive in and try something. If there's an interest that you have, or a passion, I always go back to our passions, right? Our passion is something that is going to stay with you. For no matter what you're doing. So try to reflect on what it is that you're super passionate about, and try a career or a job that is lined with that passion.


Interviewer  29:10  
Brittany, I want to thank you so much for sharing everything that you shared tonight, you been a very inspirational guest and I really appreciate you taking the time, you know, sharing your wisdom and your career journey with us.
