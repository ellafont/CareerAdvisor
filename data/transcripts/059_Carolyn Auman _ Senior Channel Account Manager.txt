Carolyn Auman _ Senior Channel Account Manager
===

[00:00:00] Jacob Sheckman: Hello and welcome. Welcome everyone to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90. 7 FM. I'm Jacob Sheckman, and you're listening to What To Be at KSQD 90. 7 FM. This is our show where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What To Be is a program provided by Your Future Is Our Business, a Santa Cruz County non profit That helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, career panels, and other work based learning activities.

[00:00:45] Jacob Sheckman: Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of Natural Bridges Media or Your Future is Our Business. The information provided during this program does not reflect this career in its entirety. And today we have the pleasure of being joined by Carolyn Allman.

[00:01:02] Jacob Sheckman: Thank you so much for being here today, Carolyn. 

[00:01:04] Carolyn Auman: Yeah, 

[00:01:05] Jacob Sheckman: absolutely. And Carolyn is here to talk to us about her current career as the senior channel account manager with Poly Plantronics. So I guess to start off, can you tell us what is Poly Plantronics and what is a senior channel account manager and what are your responsibilities in that role?

[00:01:23] Carolyn Auman: So, um, not sure how many people on the call actually know Plantronics, but for those of you who do or don't know us, um, and yes, it is Polly. Polly is the new name of the company, but we make headsets and, um, voice and video solutions. So what does that mean to you? Some of you may be gamers and we have headsets, um, that would allow you to play into your Xbox, pick, pick a system that you like, and you would actually, you know, compete, or you may have, um, uh, workout athletic wear where you.

[00:01:51] Carolyn Auman: Pair to your device, maybe your, um, your iPhone. And we have solutions like that. And then we actually have business solutions. So our business solutions are designed for like doctors that do telemed. So they actually get on their computer and make, you know, headset calls. to talk to their patients that are far away.

[00:02:10] Carolyn Auman: We also make solutions like that for corporations or companies. So maybe if you guys have ever been to Sutter, if you have a doctor that you want to see and they have somebody who picks up a phone regularly, they often have a headset on, that is a solution that Polyslash Plantronics offers. Um, my role specifically is, I am, think of a senior channel account manager as really a salesperson.

[00:02:33] Carolyn Auman: My job is to go out there and get people to buy headsets. In the past, I've done something where I've sold it directly to businesses or corporations. You might know some of those companies like, um, Google or Robert half or Apple or gosh, anyone in the Northern California, you pick, you pick a site and drive by County of Santa Cruz, UCSD, all of them.

[00:02:54] Carolyn Auman: Um, and, um, our focus is to get them to buy the poly slash Plantronics solutions. So making sure they have the best connectivity to have the best call experience. We also do voice and video, but I think anybody who is from Shoreline may have a friend or a family member that has actually been connected to Plantronics at some point because we're right over by Costco.

[00:03:16] Carolyn Auman: So you might've driven by that Plantronics building before. 

[00:03:20] Jacob Sheckman: All right. So can you tell us what, what's a day in the life like when you show up to work on a Tuesday and um, it's the world is normal, we'll say in this situation. Okay. What are you doing? 

[00:03:32] Carolyn Auman: So the world being normal, but my job is to actually see, to take a look at what products are available.

[00:03:38] Carolyn Auman: And then because my sole account is Amazon. So anybody who's ever made a purchase on Amazon right now, if you were to search Plantronics or Polycom, cause they're both brands under the Poly family. If you did a search and you, um, let's say you put a Plantronics backbeat in, if you saw that, or, um, a CS540, if you went in there and searched on that, that is what I saw.

[00:04:02] Carolyn Auman: To Amazon, they turn around and they sell it on their website. So what I would be doing is I would be tracking their purchases to see what they're purchasing. I would be tracking the investment of the marketing dollars we're spending dollars to get things marketed and get better visibility. And then I'd also be tracking like their run rate to see how much they were pulling and what makes sense.

[00:04:23] Carolyn Auman: And then altering the strategy, you know, sometimes it's daily, sometimes it's weekly, and just trying to figure out what are the best Products for that marketplace to pull from 

[00:04:33] Jacob Sheckman: Polly. Okay. And so since you said this is sort of, you said, think of this as a sales position, uh, what kind of training do you, did you get, or would you say is most necessary for getting into sales?

[00:04:45] Jacob Sheckman: And what types of skills are the most helpful here? 

[00:04:50] Carolyn Auman: Oh, gosh. Um, so I can tell you that I, there actually are formal sales trainings. Um, often you'll, when you, when someone goes into a new job, they will offer sales trainings. Um, but a lot of it is learning on the job and it also has to be some natural inclination.

[00:05:07] Carolyn Auman: If you like talking to people, Sales could be a possibility. If you like negotiating, sales could be a possibility. You know, people always say, um, Oh, that person's a really good arguer. They probably make a good attorney. Sometimes those people would actually make a good salesperson because what they're doing is they're offering constructive Points and counterpoints.

[00:05:30] Carolyn Auman: It's not just law. It's also reasonable, right? Reasonableness and getting people to connect and a halfway point. And that's what sales is about. Getting people to get to a medium point where of agreement. 

[00:05:42] Jacob Sheckman: And how do you, how do you, what are those interactions like? How do you help someone say someone doesn't necessarily want to come to an agreement at first?

[00:05:49] Jacob Sheckman: How do you kind of, what helps bring them in? 

[00:05:52] Carolyn Auman: I think, uh, well, there's different sales, sales techniques. I would say, um, I tend to be a more consultative salesperson. So there's people who walk in and they actually pull out the briefcase and they put headsets on the table and they're like, these are the headsets I have.

[00:06:07] Carolyn Auman: You should get one of these, right? There's blue, there's purple, there's green. Try, try one of them. I'm much more like, let's talk about what you want to accomplish with a business. And if we were to offer these or connect, you were to use these in your environment, how would it improve your environment?

[00:06:25] Carolyn Auman: What are, what would be the effects of it or understanding what problems they're trying to solve? For example, let's say a company, um, Has just changed their building in the way it's set up. So these, everybody used to have an office, but now they moved to open office and everybody's working together. Well, they probably need a headset solution.

[00:06:42] Carolyn Auman: That's going to block out the noise. So I'm going to show them how they're going to be more productive by actually selecting our headsets and, and what that savings represents. How many dollars does a savings like that represent, as opposed to like me, Now you can buy five of these headsets. Right. I'll give you a bottom dollar deal.

[00:07:05] Carolyn Auman: That's not what you want to do. What you really want to come in is understand what their work environment is like and how they can actually maximize their environment with your product. 

[00:07:14] Jacob Sheckman: I'm curious, I guess, what's your work environment like? I, I imagine you're in several different places. You might be out meeting with a client or you're in home at, at Poly.

[00:07:24] Jacob Sheckman: So what are those different environments like and how do they affect how you work? 

[00:07:30] Carolyn Auman: Well, there's today right now. Right? So this is my environment today. This is my living room, family room, if you will. So that solution is something that I use here. And what I would say to somebody that I was talking to now is when I'm having conversations with people right now, and I hear.

[00:07:48] Carolyn Auman: Because we're in the COVID pandemic, right? I'm having conference calls with people all day long and they have little kids walking by or they have spouses pouring ice into their ice cup, right? They're annoying people. I have headsets that I'm like, Oh, I have a headset for you. If you put it up here, you won't be able to hear anything else.

[00:08:04] Carolyn Auman: How great is that? You won't be able to hear the ice maker or the music or your, You know, I have a daughter who's a freshman in high school and a son who's a senior. And so I wouldn't have, you wouldn't have to hear all that. Now, if I go into the office, when I'm talking to somebody, let's say I walk into, um, I'll just say Apple.

[00:08:24] Carolyn Auman: If I'm talking to Apple and they're in an open environment, I'm talking to them about their noise. I'm talking to them about how is this change that you've moved to you've moved from having everybody in their office and being locked off to all being working in the same. How do they, how do they function?

[00:08:39] Carolyn Auman: Are you finding? And I started asking them questions, right? And that's what I started to do with you right now. I started to go into the natural inquiry mode. I want to know what's going on. What's working and what's not working in their environment. And you have to build trust to be able to do that. So whether I'm doing that from my own home, or I'm doing that from their office, or I'm doing that from my office, all those examples, it causes me to just pause, be present and see what I'm working with, what's going on and how do my headset solutions fit into their world?

[00:09:13] Jacob Sheckman: Are, are there any common misconceptions when, uh, if someone were to say, we just started this conversation fresh. And, uh, I was someone who asked you what, you know, Carolyn, what do you do? Are there some pretty common misconceptions that people generate when you give them some kind of answer? 

[00:09:31] Carolyn Auman: Probably, you know, it's funny as my first thought, I think I thought you were going in a different direction.

[00:09:36] Carolyn Auman: I'm a salesperson that, um, in, in my line of work, many times people think, Oh my gosh, that salesperson is going to have a 50 slide presentation and everybody's heads roll back. I mean, their eyes roll back in their heads, right? They're like, I don't want to watch another slide. I don't really care. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grownup, people don't want to watch 50 pages of PowerPoint slides.

[00:09:59] Carolyn Auman: They just don't. And so I, one thing that I will do is I will actually, I show them my deck and I'll be like, I have 50 slides here that I could walk you through, or we could just talk about you and what's going on with your business. And nine out of 10 times, people will be like, Oh, thank goodness. That's all I want to talk about is me.

[00:10:17] Carolyn Auman: Let me tell you about all my problems. And they're really, um, forthcoming. I think a couple of things when people think of sales, um, I often get the first reaction is a car salesperson. Like they don't trust, right. People are like, Oh, I don't trust them. And the salespeople 

[00:10:34] Jacob Sheckman: just cause of there's that stigma.

[00:10:36] Carolyn Auman: Oh, they're, uh, they're pro they're out to get something from you. They're, they're totally right. But let's be real. Everybody has an ask, right? Today, somebody asked me to pick up signs for them. Somebody asked me to be in a birthday car parade. Somebody asked me to, you know, give them feedback on a presentation.

[00:10:53] Carolyn Auman: People are asking me stuff for all the time, but when you're a salesperson and you ask for something, then it's like, Oh, what do you want? Right. 

[00:11:00] Jacob Sheckman: Yeah. So has, do you think you've kind of always been able to, to get over that hurdle? Cause I, I don't consider myself to be, I'll put an air quotes good at sales.

[00:11:11] Jacob Sheckman: Cause I'm nervous to make that ask. So how do you, how do you, do you get over nerve? How do you maybe advise someone to get over the nerves of, of making that ask for their, their clients? 

[00:11:23] Carolyn Auman: You know what I say is don't get in the way of helping them. So here, here's what I say. Um, it doesn't matter if I'm fundraising for the local little league baseball team, or I'm helping to fundraise for something for high school or something.

[00:11:38] Carolyn Auman: What I say is give the chance, give people the chance to say, yes, don't make the decision for them that you don't want to realize that you're giving them information and what they do with it is up to them. You can't actually. I mean, yes, there are crooks that take people, but generally speaking, that's not what happens, right?

[00:11:55] Carolyn Auman: All you're doing is bringing them information and equipping them to deal with what they're dealing with in their work environment. And then it's up to them to make the decision. And when you're really good, they keep coming back to you for all sorts of things. I know this is outside your job, but what are your thoughts on this?

[00:12:12] Carolyn Auman: Could you help me with that? Because they're constantly, they're like, Oh, now you're a trusted advisor. All right. Now they understand that you want them to succeed. And you're like, Oh, then you become in their resource pool. Oh, you know, that Carolyn Allman, she helped me out with this problem. And not only that, she knows how to get this next thing fixed.

[00:12:28] Carolyn Auman: I'll just reach out to her real quick. 

[00:12:31] Jacob Sheckman: So you're setting yourself up for, for them to keep coming back. Right, right. Amazing. Um, what, what would you say has been something that's was surprising to learn when you came into this job? Or maybe when you just started a career in sales, was there something you picked up that you didn't really expect to be there?

[00:12:50] Carolyn Auman: I love it. I love helping people problem solve. I, you know, I, it's not life or death, you know, we always say headsets, you know, their headsets, I mean, their video voice conferencing of things, they're not, you know, it's not brain surgery, but it's still making people's lives a little easier. And so it's kind of a new, a nice mix because I know when people are, you know, working and they have a better experience because they're, because of our headsets or they're working out and they have a better experience, those things make you feel good.

[00:13:22] Carolyn Auman: You're like, okay. Or being in the Santa Cruz community. I love it when somebody's like, Oh my gosh, my aunt works at your company. We love Plantronics, Polly. Those are all, those are all good things. 

[00:13:34] Jacob Sheckman: Amazing. Let's we, Hey, just a heads up, everyone. We're getting closer to the, the student question time. So you may have got my message.

[00:13:40] Jacob Sheckman: Keep them coming. Uh, I'm, I'm enjoying what I'm seeing so far and I can't wait to ask some of your questions. Uh, just a couple more here before we transfer over. What would you say is one of your most memorable Moments or projects of the career you're in now. 

[00:13:59] Carolyn Auman: I have a really interesting one. I, I sold a 10 million contract about 15 years ago and I negotiated it and I was really excited.

[00:14:09] Carolyn Auman: Itch. It made me a vice president by the time I was 30 and I was like super excited and it took me like six months to negotiate. How could it possibly take six months? I gotta tell you. Cause there were so many people who had to sign off on this. And my very favorite moment is the contract came in and it was delivered by FedEx and it was completely torn up and crunched in the mail.

[00:14:32] Carolyn Auman: And I looked at it and I was like, that's the contract. That's what I've been working on for six months. It was like, it looked like someone dug it out of the trash and dumped it in water. It was gross. And what I realized was right then and there that it's the journey that is the most exciting for me. It is everything that I was doing day in and day out to get that ink, to get that to delivery to us every day.

[00:14:58] Carolyn Auman: And so now I say to people, you know what? Interviewing is the best part. Dating is the best part. Like negotiating is the best part. It's the day in and day out journey, because once you've sealed the deal, it's done. Now you've got to go find something else to do. And the highs and the lows with it. It is the ride.

[00:15:15] Carolyn Auman: That's fun. 

[00:15:17] Jacob Sheckman: That's incredible. Thank you for sharing that story. That's a fun, I hope people, I know I can relate to that. I mentioned to Carolyn. I'm, I'm a halfway through grad school and she's totally right. It's, it's the journey that gets you to the end that, that really matters.

[00:15:37] Jacob Sheckman: For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to what to be at KSQD 90. 7 FM in Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob Sheckman and today we're speaking with Carolyn Allman and learning about her career journey to becoming the Senior Channel Account Manager at Poly Plantronics. All right, so one of the first questions I got was, how long have you been in this job?

[00:16:00] Carolyn Auman: I've actually been in this job just a little over six years. 

[00:16:04] Jacob Sheckman: And how, how long, uh, would you say you've been doing sales in general? 

[00:16:09] Carolyn Auman: Since the moment my mom opened a delicatessen, she had a sandwich shop and I was 16 and I was stocking the cupboards. Like, she would tell me how to put them in order and make all the labels show in the refrigerator the right way.

[00:16:23] Carolyn Auman: Presentation was everything. Like, when we put out cookies and brownies, she'd be like, you want to make them ready so that they'll sell. So I would say that started a long time ago. 

[00:16:32] Jacob Sheckman: Would you say this is your dream job or was there something else maybe that you thought you might have wanted to do before?

[00:16:39] Carolyn Auman: You know what I will say is the people along the way have made my job a dream at different points. The celebrations I've had along the way. There is no, I mean, yes, there have been great times at many of the locations and sites, but there hasn't been one like, oh, this is, this is it. Because that would, that would take away from the others.

[00:17:03] Carolyn Auman: Like they've been great teams. I would say that I've had many opportunities to sit in our, uh, I always call it, you know, those outrigger robots where you have eight people. I used to row crew and every once in a while you have a boat where you have eight people rowing the boat at the same time in the same direction.

[00:17:18] Carolyn Auman: And you like everybody in the boat. And when you have that, that's perfection. And I've had that a few times in my career. And so, um, those are the dream moments. It's not that I have a dream career. 

[00:17:30] Jacob Sheckman: And well explained. Thank you. Um, what would you say is the most challenging thing about your job? 

[00:17:38] Carolyn Auman: Getting people to not be afraid of Amazon.

[00:17:41] Jacob Sheckman: Yeah. Can you, uh, you talked about a little bit before the show, but maybe just a few words on that again. 

[00:17:48] Carolyn Auman: I think people are always afraid that Amazon will, um, deteriorate the pricing and to some degree, right? Because they make it a marketplace and they, um, and deteriorate the channels by which they buy.

[00:18:01] Carolyn Auman: And also they, an example would be, um, you know, let's say you guys go out with your mom and dad, you want to buy a birthday present and you shop around here locally in Santa Cruz and you find a couple of things, but you know what? You don't buy locally, you buy online. And so you're not shopping locally, you're shopping with Amazon.

[00:18:19] Carolyn Auman: There's two parts of that, right? You get it the next day with Amazon, at least you used to. And you're like, so excited about it and you have what you want. And it was the price that you want it. Um, but that's also like a, a scary thing because then you're like, well, how does the mom pop shop? maintain their existence down in Santa Cruz.

[00:18:35] Carolyn Auman: So I think there's, that's always, you know, wearisome. We don't want all these mom and pop shops to go away, but there has to be a good balance. Right. 

[00:18:44] Jacob Sheckman: Um, what is it like work to work at a company like Polly? And do you have any tips for students who maybe down the line want to go into a company that's very similar?

[00:18:54] Carolyn Auman: What I would say to you is, um, I've had the good fortune of selling to a hundred plus companies in Northern California, all the brand name brand names that you would know. And knowing the culture of the company is super important. And what does that mean? It means that everybody has a price, right? If someone said, I'll pay you this much to come work for your company.

[00:19:14] Carolyn Auman: Yeah. You could have a check and you could make X, but being in the right place with the right people does make a difference because when you spend as much time as you do. In that environment you want to be with the right people with good people that are a good fit for you and i've had um, there are many good people at poly slash plantronics and um, they've all been good and Whenever I some so many of them have left and I look and I see that i'm still friends with them on facebook or instagram They're good people and they're good santa cruz people So and and others too all over the world, by the way I have to be sure and highlight that Polly is a global company and part of its charm has been, I have made friendships all over this world.

[00:19:54] Carolyn Auman: And that includes Slovakia and Costa Rica and, you know, just countless, countless countries. I didn't even know what language they spoke in Slovakia. Did you guys know? 

[00:20:04] Jacob Sheckman: No, 

[00:20:04] Carolyn Auman: the language in Slovakia is Slovakian, but I didn't know that. So, um, uh, Polly has afforded me many of those opportunities that are just, they're priceless.

[00:20:15] Jacob Sheckman: So. It's great to, it sounds like, work for a company that can be global for the interactions that you'll make with other people. Absolutely. And, um, ooh, I just saw one that was very good here. Oh, yeah, so I think this is asking sort of in terms of how competitive it might be to get into this field. They're asking if there are too many or too few people entering this profession.

[00:20:38] Carolyn Auman: There's, there's always room for a good salesperson. Always. I, you know what, I've never heard that we have, there's too many salespeople. And when the economy is down and people and companies are having trouble, you know what they want? They want a new sales force. They want a sales force that can go out and generate money to, cause the sales force is what generates money for the company to continue running.

[00:20:58] Carolyn Auman: Right? 

[00:20:58] Jacob Sheckman: What do you mean by a new sales force? 

[00:21:01] Carolyn Auman: Um, sometimes when sales forces get stagnant or they're not producing what they need to, sometimes they do a Salesforce refresh. Um, they want to go find new talent that can sell. 

[00:21:11] Jacob Sheckman: Okay. 

[00:21:11] Carolyn Auman: So I think there's always opportunity for sales. And you know what? A lot of people don't like to sell, right?

[00:21:17] Carolyn Auman: They don't want to be that person. I don't want to be that car salesperson. I, you know, I remember saying to somebody once they said, you'd make a good salesperson. I was like, that's just the biggest insult you've ever told me. I'm like, I'm not a salesperson. I'm an account manager. What does that mean? I was like, that means I don't go out and call people and say, please buy my stuff, you know, or like, you have to buy this and then be, you know, have snake oil in the background.

[00:21:40] Carolyn Auman: That's not, it's not like that. You, When you're a good salesperson, you're basically a good consultant, right? You're helping somebody along with their own business initiatives. 

[00:21:51] Jacob Sheckman: Right. I, you figure if they've reached out to you already, they're, they're not thinking that you're going to try and harm them. So can you talk to us a little bit about your, your education?

[00:22:02] Jacob Sheckman: I see the, the O on your sweatshirt there. Where did you go to college? And when you went to college, did you go there with this job in mind? 

[00:22:12] Carolyn Auman: Oh, not at all. So I was the kid who in school, you know, when they said, and probably eighth grade, even, what do you want to be when you grow up? And I watched everybody else and they're like, doctor or lawyer or whatever.

[00:22:23] Carolyn Auman: And so I naturally put my hand up and said, lawyer, because that sounded good. Um, but I didn't have a clue. And it was just easier to just pick one thing and say the one thing to everybody, because I was like, I don't know. I don't know what is out there. I ended up going to the University of Oregon. I majored in telecommunications and film under the communications journalism school.

[00:22:45] Carolyn Auman: And the thought was that I would, as I got further along, And I was like, Hey, I can be a news anchor. I can be the next Katie Couric, you know, pick a name. I can, I can get up there and do that. And then I found out you needed to go like to some small town in like South Dakota. And then I was like, I'm not going to do that.

[00:23:01] Carolyn Auman: That's not going to happen. Um, but I didn't, here's what, here's what I say to people who don't know what they want to do. First of all, God, gosh, God bless the people who know who want what they want to do. That's so great that they wake up and they know they're. They might be lucky, but the people who don't want to know what I say is they have the opportunity to hear many things.

[00:23:23] Carolyn Auman: So I never missed an opportunity because I wasn't so focused on one thing. If something came up and I wanted to try it, I could try it because it wasn't locked into anything. And so I think the weaving path can also be just as rewarding. You just have to be open to what gets presented to you and then be comfortable with not a fit, cross it off your list.

[00:23:43] Carolyn Auman: Not a fit, cross it off your list and it's not that you're failing. You're not failing. You're on your way to succeeding. You're just crossing things off your list. 

[00:23:51] Jacob Sheckman: Yeah. Sometimes you have to close the doors, you know, aren't right for you. So is your, how flexible is your schedule? Do you have a, with your job, do you have a lot of time?

[00:24:01] Jacob Sheckman: Do you feel for yourself and for your family? 

[00:24:04] Carolyn Auman: Um, this is always an interesting question. I this is just about time management. I will tell you that I have a good work life balance. I always wonder how much people are in control of that. I don't really know. And I try not to judge other people on that. I like my life and I like the free time I have and I do spend it with my family.

[00:24:25] Carolyn Auman: And, um. I, I feel, uh, lucky to have that what I will say is that work does pop up, it does get in the way and I have been known to shush my family while I have to work. So I want to be realistic and tell you there have been days where I've been on 6 AM calls or I've been, you know, I miss my daughter's, uh, dance recital one time when I was on my way to Europe.

[00:24:49] Carolyn Auman: It's not all perfect, but, um, it's full of decisions and nine out of 10 times you can work around stuff. And if people are, um, usually when you're human and you say, Hey, you know what, I have something really important. I missed that one dance recital. I never missed another one because I said, Hey, this is what I have going on.

[00:25:05] Carolyn Auman: Is there any chance we could just schedule around it? And 10 times people are like, sure. Yeah, we can work, we can work with that. Because any other time I'm saying to them, Hey, I can be flexible for you. You tell me when works for you. 

[00:25:18] Jacob Sheckman: Thanks. 

[00:25:18] Carolyn Auman: And when they hear that you're trying to work for them, with them, for them, around them, they're super grateful and willing to, um, afford you the same kindness.

[00:25:26] Jacob Sheckman: Yeah, of course. It's, it's nice to have that sort of amicable relationship when people know that you're working with them. Uh, what, was there a piece of advice or, or, Some sort of lesson that was given to you that helped you within your career, or maybe just in life in general, something you like to follow.

[00:25:43] Carolyn Auman: Um, I had a CEO who was in charge of, um, uh, Baxter Healthcare with a pharmaceutical. Um, he had this thing, I remember one time, I went to a colleague's graduation from, uh, MBA school. And he showed up and I was like, wow, he's here. And then I had a baby and he showed up and I was like, wow, he's here. And then I started seeing the thread and I realized that he just showed up.

[00:26:10] Carolyn Auman: He wasn't always there for his people and whether it's professional or personal showing up makes all the difference in the world. It makes people, it connects you with people. And, um, I Embraced his practice. 20 years ago. I've pushed it on to my kids. Both my kids know how to show up and I would say the winners are the people who show up.

[00:26:34] Carolyn Auman: If you're the first person there to help set up for something and the last person to leave, people remember that over and over again. And, um, it, it is, it's rewarding and it's also, um, It just it pays a million dividends 

[00:26:53] Jacob Sheckman: Incredible i'd stick with that motto folks. They show up. It really Invaluable, so we've hit our 28 minute mark.

[00:27:01] Jacob Sheckman: We've only got a couple. This is about the last question here And I really just is there anything that you want to leave us leave us off with our listeners and our students Uh anything you'd like for for them to know?
