Interviewer  1:02  
Now, finally, it is my pleasure today to introduce our guest, Andrea Willy! Thank you so much for being here, Andrea. 

Interviewee  1:09  
Hi, thank you, Jacob. Happy to be here. 

Interviewer  1:12  
Andrea is here to talk to us about her career journey and position as the District Grant Writer for The Pajaro Valley Unified School District. Do I call it my alma mater? If I graduated from that district, does that still apply?

Interviewee  1:26  
Yeah, it usually refers to a particular institution, but the whole district makes us all feel privileged.

Interviewer  1:32  
Yeah, I'm proud to have come from there. So can you tell us exactly what you do as the District grant writer? 

Interviewee  1:41  
Yeah, so as the District grant writer, in PVUSD, it's a relatively new position brought on by the new superintendent, Dr. Michelle Rodriguez, I am here to kind of scan the environment, the funding environment, to find new opportunities to bolster programs that are driving success with students.

Interviewer  1:59  
And how long have you been in this position? 

Interviewee  2:02  
I've been here now three years. And it's been a very, very exciting journey, and I find that every single piece of my professional life has come into play here. And it's a very exciting chance to share what I know and my past.

#BACKGROUND 

Interviewer  2:19  
Yeah, awesome. Let's talk about your past a bit. How? How did you end up here? I want to know everything! What's your your education background? Where have you worked before? How did you end up here?

Interviewee  2:32  
Yeah, so I had the great fortune to be the daughter of a professor at UC Santa Barbara. And so my personal trajectory was always to do well in school, and to love learning. And that has been very true. I am a lifelong learner, went off to college, in Boston. Following college, where I hit earned a medical anthropology degree, which taught me a lot about observational skills, data collection, honouring different perspectives, if you will, and scanning and thinking of any environment I'm in as a culture. And that can be, whether it's a place you work, community, a society, right, so all those different levels. When I used that learning to go on to human rights advocacy work in Boston for a number of years, which really met well with my advocacy and passion that drive everything I do. And following that, I went and worked in bioethics education at a hospital in nursing homes around patient decision making, and in particular end of life decision making. 

Interviewer  3:44  
How did you make that that connection there, I can see the connection maybe between bioethics and human rights, but still both are very kind of niche. 

Interviewee  3:54  
They are. Well, Boston is an academic city, with more probably universities and colleges than anywhere else you find and nonprofits abound. And we had a great career office back in the day, many, many years ago, we didn't have the internet, but boy, they had finders and any nonprofit that was looking for students coming out of top level universities, than 10 fliers. And that's where I would go and find out new things that were happening. And you know, most of your interviewees have probably said there are times in your career where you feel the need to move on like you've done what you've done and the organization or the staff is ready for change, or you personally are and so it just when I was ready, I went looked at some binders and I said, Oh my gosh, that looks like another amazing opportunity. I'm interested in ethics. And because it was bioethics, and I had a medical anthropology degree, I gravitated to it and again, opened up a whole new place where I would learn so much got to read the literature as a research associate on that project. Talk with top level ethicists in the nation. In fact, our principal investigator on that project is now the head of the Hastings Center for Bioethics in New York, which is one of the most prestigious organizations. So a lot of it is being in the right place at the right time, perhaps and again, privilege to have grown up in a family with a professor for a father. Right? 

Interviewer  5:22  
Yeah, I can relate very much with my father being in academics, and now he's a professor. 

Interviewee  5:29  
You have an uncle, and he's a pretty big name. For anyone listening, Randy Schekman.  Look them up, see what comes up, I've met Randy, he comes to some of our events. So I just wanted to give you a shout out too. Yeah, and then after the bioethics piece, I decided to come back to California, right. Born and raised here, it's hard to take the California out of someone. And I returned and using my experiences, I started to do some consulting work in East LA with hospitals. My uncle had worked in that community for many years. That's where my father was born and raised, in East LA. 

Interviewee  6:09  
And there was a brand new hospital going up called the USC University Hospital, which would be a high end, non emergency room, where the USC faculty could bring private paying patients or high level insurance patients, you know, wasn't much of a public service mission, but they had a need to understand their community. Why aren't local Latino physicians referring patients to us, we don't understand. And so I went out and used my anthropology lens. And it's an informational interviewing and shared feedback with them on the fact that there's actually a disconnect here, you know, you are privileged people coming into their community, and they perceive it as almost a threat. And when you don't give them admitting privileges, or reach out to them and try to form relationships, maybe that's why you're not getting referrals. So it was a really fun project. 

Interviewee  7:02  
And I just stayed on at that hospital, they decided that they liked my style of communication, my attention to detail, my inquiry based thinking, and started to ask me to take on running different departments that were non clinical, because I don't have a clinical background. And I just rapidly became, you know, a manager at a high level in a in a hospital system. And again, my medical anthropology training understood to look at that hospital, as a particular institution with beliefs and practices intact and learn to navigate them well, to look at that, that institution with such a perspective, as opposed to what how else were people trying to perceive these before? Yeah, a lot of people in a hospital system in particular, it's very hierarchical. In fact, it's a it's astonishing, perhaps changing a bit more. And of course, something like the current pandemic we're in often levels, the playing field of hierarchy, because everyone is hands on deck. And there is no hierarchy we are serving the emergent need at the moment, but in that time, very hierarchical right positions at the top, anything from a concern about, I can't find a place to park when a physician says that it's met with a very different lens than a patient saying it took me 15 minutes in the parking lot to find a parking space. Right. Yeah. And so I would help navigate that. And, and eventually, what I found was that because I had such a passionate human rights and, and social justice lens in, in my personal philosophy that working for a for profit hospital, started to not be my favorite. And so I decided I needed to make a change and, and at that time, my dad was retiring. And my parents were moving up here to Watsonville, where my mom, her family has actually been here in this county since the early 1800s. And, I mean, gosh,

Interviewee  9:10  
we could do an hour interview, but I only have 35 minutes or 30 minutes. And so my parents moved up here. And at that time, I was married and had two little ones. And I said, Well, I don't want to be away from my family. So we moved up here. And I had the great fortune to stay home for a number of years and raise my children. But I immediately knowing my love of education and learning spent as much time as I could in their schools, running for site councils, starting special projects, looking through the equity lens, making sure that my students who had me, as a parent, if I'm going to do something to benefit my child, I needed to make sure that it was something that I could bring other students along with them. So starting, you know, special projects at the high school, elementary school, middle school to inspire students and then when our new superintendent came on board here in Pajaro Valley, I made it a point to get to meet her and know her and when this position to be a district grant writer opened up, I applied because I had worked and sat on many nonprofit boards over the years. In fact, going back to my time at the Human Rights Organization, the bioethics organization, those were in fact, grant funded nonprofits, largely. So Ford Foundation was Physicians for Human Rights. You know, we were all grant funded. So we did grant reporting, we understood the messaging and cycle of grants. And then the bioethics education program was through the WK Kellogg Foundation in Michigan. So I'd kind of lived and breathed the grant world for many years. And when this opportunity at PVUSD opened up, I thought, this is this is for me, I'm ready.

#MOTIVATION

Interviewer  11:00  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to What To Be at KSQD 90.7. FM Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob Schekman. And today we're speaking with Andrea Willy and learning about her career journey to becoming the district grant writer at The Pajaro Valley Unified School District. Okay, so you mentioned the new superintendent was hired, and you made it a point to talk and meet with with her. Can you talk about your motivation as to why you would want to do that and how that was clear? You talked about eventually how it led to a job. But I want people to understand why what you did is so important.

Interviewee  11:34  
Well, like I said earlier, my family has been a part of this community since the early 1800s. And my children are in the school district. And I understood the disparity and the conditions of poverty that some of our students live with. And we all can track the numbers, and we were seeing a flatline in the numbers. And we knew that it was time for a leadership shift. And in fact, our school board made that change. And so I thought, I want this new superintendent, after I heard her speak a couple of times, I said, Oh, my gosh, we need this person to be successful here. And so I  am willing to go to bat and speak about her in community forums, and support her work, because her work matters. And she articulated early on that she was student centered and mission driven. And that's how I view my life. And so there was a fast alignment there. And then I interviewed, I was fortunate enough to be given the position, and I have not looked back. And so, you know, my day to day work here, over the three years, has evolved in terms of what I've been able to bring to the district we've brought in through either independent single district level grants or collaborative grants with partners or supporting external partners, who serve our students and need some grant writing support. We've brought in about $11 million in three years. Oh, my God. That's a lot of funding. Well, there's not that there's high need here. It's that there's exciting work going on in this district to support our students and prepare them. When I started, the buzz was the 21st century. Well, we're kind of beyond the beginning of the 20th. And it's really more about having them become life ready, right. So we've expanded the definition of student success in this district. And so we're looking for dollars and programs and partnerships that aligned to that. And it's also a whole child lens in this district now. So for many years, people thought of a school system as one that imparts knowledge through learning. We now take care of the whole child. So we impart knowledge through learning, but we look for and treat students with compassion. They have behavioral learning needs, they have social emotional learning needs. And we as a system, were never designed to do that. But in fact, because we hold their little souls all day long, that isn't our mandate. And so that's what we do. And so part of it is scanning this emerging acknowledgement of what we do for funding resources, and then writing grants to acquire those funds to support programs we're doing.

Interviewer  14:22  
Can you talk a little bit more about your specific day to day work? Say the world is normal, you show up on a Tuesday, what are you doing? What's the routine?

Interviewee  14:32  
Yeah, I'm an early riser. I get in early, and I spend usually my first two hours doing learning I am scanning I am signed up on listservs up the wazoo in the education world and the social emotional learning world in the Foundation Philanthropy world, in the government funding world, and I started scanning my emails, and by scanning I mean, I open each one and I scan that document for something that might inspire me, or that speaks to what we are doing on the ground at this moment in time, and I read it. And then I share it with people who might have interest in our organization and our community partners. And what I'm doing by doing that is honoring the fact that we have to learn, but we also have to stay relevant, move quickly, and embrace our partners as we go forward. So I'm building a community around, what can we possibly do next? So I spent about two hours doing that. People now know to expect emails from me with new information. And then those who are excited by something and opportunities that might be there, we'll write back and say, What do you think, can we do this? And then I'll say, let's meet, let's connect, and let's talk about why this funding opportunity interested you? How does it speak to driving your personal agenda for students in this district, and how does it align? This is always important, how does it align to the stated El Cap goals and mission of our district? Right? will it serve our students best? And who can we partner with to do it?

Interviewer  16:12  
As you're as you're talking and giving me this info? These two words that keep coming to mind about you are proactivity. You're constantly like how you said you wanted to go up to bat for your students and your kids, the things that you tell me you're involved with are so much more admittedly than I imagined. For a district grant writer, I thought that that would be that. But there's so much more that you have to you. And  I'm curious, I wonder if you happen to have any any stories that might tell us a little bit about where this came from?

Interviewee  16:54  
Yeah, I think I just I'd really do love learning, right. And I and I practice that a lot. In school, you know, I was a top student, it was a game I could win. And I wanted to win. And grant writing is somewhat like that, too. It is a game, if you will, in that you have to scan the field, you have to know your competition, you have to know if you are going to be a division one athlete in that moment. And if you're not a division one athlete, then don't go after that particular grant resource, right? If there are many other competitors in the field, who are going to win, you're spinning your wheels, but watch, and still read and learn so that when your organization is ready, you are in. So I do that. And you're right. I am very proactive. Maybe it's because I'm a middle child. I was always fanning what was happening in my family. I got to dodge this. I don't know if you're a middle ch ild. 

Interviewer  17:48  
I'm the baby. 

Interviewee  17:50  
Oh, you're the baby?

Interviewer  17:52  
Oh yeah, It's great. 

#NECESSARY SKILLS

Interviewee  17:53  
Yeah. And as a middle child, I was just navigating that environment, right? To stay out of trouble, advantage myself. But be thought, and that's what I do here. And, and when you say the word proactive about me, I think I am because I'm always thinking ahead. So what grant writers do in addition to scanning the field and putting funding opportunities from either governmental sources, philanthropic organizations, in front of people to say, Does this look like something we're interested in? I also am really, really dedicated to learning the the latest iteration of our story, what is our student's story, and our students story isn't just grounded in the moment, but in their potential. And their potential is linked directly to my organization's potential to serve them well. And that's what I want to do. And so I'm looking for that change. I'm looking for the data points. I'm looking for the other leaders in districts like ours, right, with high poverty students to see what are they doing? What are they tracking? What grants are they going after? Which people are they following? And that's how I've built my base of who I follow with emails or on social media. And then I'm thinking that through, do we fit? Are we ready to fit and then we jump. Yeah, it's a really fun job. And of course, there's like fundamental skill sets that you do want to have.

Interviewer  19:28  
Oh, yeah, let's hear those.

Interviewee  19:30  
Fundamental skill sets are you do want to be a good writer, you know, you want to be detail oriented. And it does help to be a bit of an extrovert in my particular grant writing position. Because I'm connecting with community partners. I am engaging people and trying to get information out of them so that I understand you can help them tell their story. I have to be somewhat data-savvy, because data drives a lot of things right now, people want to know that their dollars have impact. And then you have to also kind of be conceptual thinkers. So if you are on the cutting edge, going after dollars for new and interesting programs, which is my charge, I'm not doing the basic grants that we get from the federal government, or the state that sort of keep things moving. That's a different type of grant writing, but it is grant writing, mine is more, you know, relevant, active and responsive to what's of interest to people. So that's kind of where it falls. Yeah.

Interviewer  20:44  
When you're working on grants within the district. How are you sometimes working with individual schools? Programs? How exactly is it working? Who are you writing these grants for within the district?

Interviewee  20:59  
Yeah, that's a great question. There's a range. And again, it will depend on the initiative. Sometimes you have a school that has a special program. And so we're writing for that program at that school, or it might be a program across many schools, but not all. And so then we're writing to expand capacity to spread that program, because we know and we've been able to measure that it has impact on our students. And so we want more of it. So we do that. And I tend to focus more on higher dollar grants, there are a lot of grants, I will offer to do technical reads for, say, teachers or a site that's going after, you know, one to $5,000 that I have been asked to prioritize my time on the higher level Grants. And so they tend to be system-wide, or a cluster of schools, or they are around a particular initiative that we want to start and test somewhere. And then we'll launch it further if it shows promise. Right. So with grants, it's not just the return on investment is measured in many ways, but mainly on how is it impacting our students? And is it moving them forward in a criteria area that matters to us, and to this community?


Interviewer  22:29  
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to What To Be at KSQD 90.7. FM Santa Cruz. I'm Jacob Schekman. And today we're speaking with Andrea Willie and learning about her career journey to becoming the district grant writer at the Pajaro Valley Unified School District. What would you say is the least favorite or maybe most stressful part of your position now?

Interviewee  22:53  
Ooh, so if you are a procrastinator, and you don't like deadlines, then grant writing may not be for you. So deadlines are imperatives. And it takes time as a grant writer to understand how to manage the cycle of writing with multiple authors and meeting your deadlines. Right, reading an RFA, which means a Request for Application or an RFP, a request for proposal, which is how we learn about funding opportunities, you have to read that well, you have to be proactive, and forward plan a timeline that allows for bumps in the road and learn who in your organization you go to for the data pieces that you need. And then you are facilitating getting content from different partners for the pieces you need. If you don't like working on deadlines or timelines that in essence aren't your own, right, somebody else has dictated it to you because of what they want from you, then maybe it's not for you. But it doesn't mean that someday you might not be part of a grant and writing something. And so maybe you've learned something by listening to me about that. That's probably the only thing that is maybe off putting, I would say if you if you love to learn, communicate, and you have a nonprofit, domain or area of concern that matters deeply to you, then grant writing is a great way to be able to express your allegiance to that interest whether it is youth, you know, I don't want to get political here. But whatever your interest is, there's a way to support organizations doing good work that you love, and this is one way to do it. 


Interviewer  24:55  
Wonderful. I've answered my next question, which was the other side of the coin. Thank you. What would you say, do you have a most memorable moment from this job? Or your your career? In general? Any any most memorable, rewarding moment?

Interviewee  25:15  
I would say it's more a series of moments. I would say there. And I'll limit it to this three year timespan here, I would say that there are moments where I've been working on a particular project, writing something, or stewing on how to articulate a concept or a story to have meaning to the audience who is my funder, and that may be different. And I say to myself, Ash, who would have thought that what I did 25 years ago, in that other job would come and be the most profound piece of experience I'm bringing to this. That would be what I would say that there, I have those moments. And I say, thank goodness, I worked in human rights, with Physicians for Human Rights. Thank goodness, well, here COVID, bioethics, end of life decision making. My capacity to digest, and be thoughtful and have empathy for those going through the loss of loved ones understanding how a health organization is responding to this crisis is deep because of my training, and my experience, and as challenging as that is, I'm so privileged to have that deeper lens through which to look at what's happening.

#CONCLUSION

Interviewer  26:47  
Perfect. Do you have any bit of advice, or something you might want our students and listeners to know, as we send off here?

Interviewee  26:56  
Yeah, my advice would be if you really enjoy writing as a mechanism for imparting change or impacting the world,if you 're not a public speaker, if you don't like making phone calls, but you'd like to write, explore on the Internet what a grant writer does, and perhaps ask to shadow someone in a nonprofit that you love, and say, I'd love to learn how you do that, because maybe it's for me, and not all organizations have a dedicated grant writer. In fact, in our community, there are people who freelance doing grant writing in certain domains, and that may be a path for you. But again, it all depends on what you love and experience with organizations, and managing relationships. All come into play. But I would say if you love to write and tell stories, and you're passionate about something, this could be a career for you. So give me a call.

Interviewer  28:03
