# JOB DESCRIPTION

Interviewer 01:03
So, can you tell us, what is a Resident Services Manager?

Jose Ybarra 01:07
A Resident Services Manager does a little bit of everything. I have a staff that I work with. I first of all work in a housing complex, affordable housing. We do activities for the residents. So, something I do during the school year is have an out-of-school time for our kids, our youth. We also, for our adults that live there, do curriculum as well. Like, we have San Jose State School of Nursing that comes down and checks on our residents, vital signs, helps them understand their meds if they have meds, helps them with basically anything. I have a resident that doesn't know how to read and she needed distilled water. She never knew what distilled water was because she didn't know how to read. So the students helped out by showing her a picture. She would always go to the store with a picture until she found the one that matched what it said.

We also do other things like community events where I partner with the Santa Cruz Parks and Rec, Louden Nelson Teen Center, Nueva Vista Center, the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Cruz. We hold activities in the summer for kids. Our partnership with Parks and Rec lets us go swimming at the Harvey West pool site. It's completely free to us. It's paid for by Friends of Parks and Rec. Also, our committee comes together once a year and does one huge party. It's called The Family Fair where we have barbecue, a jump house, a dunk tank, swimming pools are open and the park that we're using. It's absolutely free to anybody that comes.

In my personal time, I help people with any kind of situation, if they need help with understanding their medical records, I can help them go to the medical appointments and help them understand it. I do all kinds of translations. There's so much that I do as the manager though. I also work with my staff, and I guide them on how to do their jobs as well. I'm actually training a brand new staff member. She's only a week into the job. I also do conflict resolution. It's a whole bunch of stuff that I do that's really rewarding and also challenging, and it gets to you personally and on a personal level.

# BACKGROUND AND CAREER PATH

Interviewer 03:11
Can you tell us about your background and how you kind of got into this position?

Jose Ybarra 03:15
Yeah. So, I originally started at Footlocker and I was like, "Is this still my life?" But my cousin, who I was very close to, I had just barely come back from vacation, visiting him in Arizona. Two days later, he was actually hit by a car. The police thought he was dead. So, they left him there and they did not do any life resuscitation stuff for him. When they saw him moving and trying to actually get up, that's when they did everything. As a result, he went five minutes without oxygen, and he became brain-damaged. He has a traumatic brain injury now, and that kind of... he was my best friend. So, I wanted to learn everything that he was going through. I ended up working with people with disabilities, and I started learning that route. Then I was like, "Wow, I love this so much." I thought, "I need to get a degree in social work so that I can be a social worker and do this work for people to help out." And I've had a ball ever since.

I got my degree in Human Services. Quite funny, because as soon as I got my degree, I actually got recruited by Mercy Housing. My supervisor at the time came over and asked, "Hey, are you looking for a new job?" And I was like, "Not really, I love what I'm doing right now."

Interviewer 04:41
What position did you start off as?

Jose Ybarra 04:42
I was a Resident Service Coordinator.

Interviewer 04:44
And had you volunteered or interned there before?

Jose Ybarra 04:46
Never. What happened was that our facility at the time shut down. We needed a place to host our people with disabilities. So, I asked Mercy Housing if we could use their community rooms, because we do have a community room in every single one of our properties. They agreed. Carmen, my supervisor, kept watching what I was doing. She saw that I was the leader of that section. She actually asked me if I wanted to join, and I said, "Sure." After a while, I said, "Yeah, let's do it." The rest is history. I've been here for six years now, going on seven.

# ABOUT MERCY HOUSING

Interviewer 05:23
What is Mercy Housing exactly? And I know that it's national, right?

Jose Ybarra 05:26
Yeah, it's nationwide. It's affordable housing. Mercy Housing was founded by the Sisters of Mercy of Omaha, Nebraska. They believed that people needed more than just affordable housing to survive. So, they came up with resident services. From there, that's how we went on to doing what we do now. Our focus is on health and wellness. Anything that's done with health and wellness, like the nurse visits that we have, we have food that comes out to our properties and stuff like that. Something really cool is that I'm bringing a dental program to our sites that will be affordable for our residents to use. We also believe in housing stability. If our residents can afford to pay the rent, that's what we're there for, to help them find resources. We also do financial stability seminars with them. We do a book called "Your Money, Your Goals," which tracks where their money goes for the vast majority of the time. A real big key component right now that we're pushing is out-of-school time. Our kids are the future. How are we going to mold them to be great people in the future?

I remember when I first got to my site, one of my kids came up to me and said, "Hey, I'm going to work at McDonald's and live with my family." And I remember saying, "Oh, no, no, no, that's never going to work." So, I reached out to UCSC to have kids from equally, you know, backgrounds of affordable housing types to come out and show that they come to UCSC for school. These kids can be bigger and better. As a result, I have had one of my kids graduate from college, UC Santa Barbara. I was invited to his graduation two weeks ago.

Interviewer 07:11
That's so exciting.

Jose Ybarra 07:12
Yeah.

# TYPICAL DAY AND TASKS

Interviewer 07:14
Can you walk us through a typical day and the tasks you do, if there is one?

Jose Ybarra 07:18
Every day is so random and different. During the summer, we really work with the kids. We're taking the kids hiking, and they bring their lunch with them. We go hiking for the day, or we go swimming in the pools. We take them to the movies. We do a lot of different things during the summer with our kids. We also do resident meetings. Yesterday, one of our property managers was actually leaving today. So, we threw her a going-away party, and the whole entire community came in and brought so much great food. I was in food coma mode for a while. It's all about the connection. For example, yesterday, we were passing out flyers because we make flyers for everyone, a calendar of events of what we do for the residents. In walking, I ran into like two or three different families. I'm like, "You're going to take your kids swimming, right? You're going to come with us?" And they're like, "Yeah, sure." Three families did show up, and it was just amazing to see how many people actually showed up with their kids.

Interviewer 08:23
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to What to Be at KSQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Melina and I'm joined by other hosts, Emily. We are speaking with Jose Ybarra and learning about his journey to becoming a Resident Services Manager at Mercy Housing. Can you tell us more about what inspires you to come to work every day and what you love most about it?

Jose Ybarra 08:42
What inspires me to come to work every day is basically knowing that I'm going to change at least one person's life every single day. I have seen a lot of lives changed because of the services that we provide. For example, we get an intern from UCSC every year. One of our interns was struggling because she didn't know what she wanted to do. By the time she finished, she said, "I know exactly what I want to do now. I want to be a social worker." So that changed her entire trajectory of what she wanted to do in life. Now she's going to go help people out. I remember another resident who used to be shy and introverted. We got her into a program where she started learning English. She came to me one day and said, "I have my first job interview." She got the job, and she's now working and thriving. It's seeing those successes that keep me going every day.

# CHALLENGES

Interviewer 09:34
What are some challenges that you face in your job?

Jose Ybarra 09:38
One of the challenges I face is seeing the hardships that some of our residents go through. A lot of our residents are low-income or no-income families, and they struggle with paying their rent or buying groceries. It's tough to see that and to try to help them find resources. Another challenge is dealing with mental health issues. We have a lot of residents who suffer from depression or anxiety, and it's hard to see them go through that. But we try to provide as many resources as we can to help them out.

Interviewer 10:07
How do you handle the emotional toll that your job can take on you?

Jose Ybarra 10:11
I have a great support system at work. My colleagues and I are like a family, and we support each other through the tough times. I also try to take time for myself and do things that I enjoy outside of work, like spending time with my family and friends, going for walks, and practicing mindfulness. It's important to take care of yourself so that you can take care of others.

# ADVICE FOR ASPIRING SOCIAL WORKERS

Interviewer 10:35
What advice would you give to someone who is interested in pursuing a career in social work or a similar field?

Jose Ybarra 10:39
I would say to definitely go for it. It's a rewarding career, and you get to make a difference in people's lives every day. But also be prepared for the challenges. It's not always easy, and it can be emotionally draining. Make sure you have a good support system and take care of yourself. Also, get as much experience as you can, whether it's through volunteering, internships, or working in related fields. The more experience you have, the better prepared you'll be for the challenges you'll face.

Interviewer 11:07
That's great advice. Thank you so much for being here today and sharing your journey with us.

Jose Ybarra 11:11
Thank you for having me.

# EARLY CAREER AND JOB REQUIREMENTS

Interviewer 11:46
And earlier in the interview, you mentioned that you speak different languages, right? And you translate for people Correct? Can you mention like, what other kind of skills and qualities are good to have in this job?

Jose Ybarra 11:56
Well, for me, I have to translate for the nursing students who do not speak Spanish. So that's one thing that I do, I also do social work aspects stuff. So like going to housing authority and dealing with them and knowing how to deal with them. You can't just go in and think you're gonna get a meeting right away, just set that meet him up right away. Before you come in being able to repeat the question one more time,

Interviewer 12:19
what kind of skills and qualities are needed for Okay, yeah,

Jose Ybarra 12:23
well definitely be working on the computer a lot. We have different programs that we use that, that probably no one else ever uses. So learning that stuff is kinda what kind of programs it's called Mercy measures, like your own Yeah, we have our own any tracks everything that we do, but also outlook, learning how to use your calendar, your email, I mean, that was kind of foreign concept to me. I was like, what we have to do emails, I know how to do my own, but I you know, having your own email address with your name on it.org. And it's like, Oh, my God, I'm somebody or your business cards? Oh, wow. Yeah, learning, a lot of this stuff is on the computer, like Microsoft Office, you know, Excel, we have to do a lot of calendars. So you have to know how to do that in Publisher. Again, our jobs are probably a little bit more unique than other social workers just for the fact that we deal with our clients on a regular basis, our residents and, and so it's a different type of activity, instead of probably some of the spreadsheets that other people would use.

# CHALLENGES AND REWARDS

Interviewer 13:24
And then what would you say is the hardest or most challenging part of your job? For

Jose Ybarra 13:29
me, sometimes it's still is the residents, you know, they, they come in, and they still don't like sharing some stuff with me. So, you know, something that should only take probably like 1015 minutes will probably take an hour to an hour and a half to get to the bottom line of like, what's really going on. But again, you have to have that patience with them. And you have to be open and inviting and make them feel like I can come here and share anything, you know. Yeah.

Interviewer 13:58
Do you have any interesting stories related to your job as a resident Services Manager?

Jose Ybarra 14:04
Well, there's so many different things that I could share. You know, I know you guys are gonna go on to this question probably later on. But for me, one of the most interesting stories that I have, is one of my residents was suffering from depression. And she came in on a Friday to load up her laundry cart. And I said, you you look really rough, we need to get you some counseling. And she agreed. And so she said, Well, I'll come back later, and I kind of dropped it from there because I completely you know, when when you do so much the following day, she committed suicide. And I, I died, I died inside because I knew I could have prevented it. And it was the hardest thing I've ever gone through and and I failed that family. And to this day, it's still like emotionally gets me Because I know I felt that family and I I see the kids now the kid that graduated from Santa Barbara was the kid that, you know, the mother passed away. And the other two kids are also striving and surviving. And one of them's going to become a doctor or a nurse, I believe. Yeah, yeah. And the youngest one, well, he's a cook, and he totally loves his job. It's one of the hardest things for a long time. You know, I thought, Okay, I'll deal with it on Monday. And, you know, if I noticed someone struggling, I'm not waiting a second more. And I think that's what made me a better person. What I do,

Interviewer 15:44
you have like an actual story that relates that you carried with you every day that influences your work, right? Yeah.

Jose Ybarra 15:50
Another interesting story that I might have for you guys, as San Jose State School of Nursing and I, our partnership has literally saved the life of one of our residents. We have a transplant patient, or organ transplant transplant patient. That's hard to say. I guess her kidneys were starting to fail her and her blood sugar's were going extremely high. And they had called me to tell me, you know, hey, this person's blood sugars is high, what should we do? And, and I remember going, Okay, let me call her doctor. And so I called her doctor and the doctor said, rush her to the emergency room. Now she's going to have a massive heart attack. And they did that. They called 911. We got her to the ER, and they were able to help her out, stabilize her. And the doctor had literally said, If we hadn't done what we did in partnership with San Jose State, she would be dead.

# CAREER INSIGHTS AND REFLECTIONS

Interviewer 16:44
Wow. Yeah. Is there something that you wish that you had known before you started your work?

Jose Ybarra 16:51
You know, honestly, I didn't know how much I would love this job. You know, I think I love all my jobs. I've never had a doubt like, oh my god, I'm gonna retire from footlocker oh my god, I retire from work with people disabilities. Now I'm like, Oh, my God, I'm gonna retire doing this. You know, I love all my jobs. I've always loved the fact that I've always helped people. I think, you know, if you know that, that's your passion, then do it. And have fun doing it, depending on what you do, whether it's working for the county office and working in doing investigations for child abuse, you know, I, my friend does that you know, who used to work with us or whether you go off to UCSC and work out there to help people out, you know, you just got to know what your love and passion is in order to, to, to do it. And I found my love. And I found my passion. And it's showing everyone you know, when when our property manager was is while she's leaving today, as her last day, they were all like they see my new employee like, who are you? Are you the new

Jose Ybarra 18:12
manager? And I'll be like, No, it's the new coordinator. The new coordinators. Are you leaving too? I'm like, no, no, we're training her for another place. It's really cool. The connections I've made and I wish I would have known how much fun I would have actually had doing the job. Now that all the residents are behind me and everything. It's, it's been such a blast to do. Yeah.

Interviewer 18:30
For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to what to be at K SQD 90.7 FM Santa Cruz. I'm Alina and I'm joined by other hosts Emily, we're speaking with Jose Ybarra. And he is the resident Services Manager of the Santa Cruz region for Mercy Housing. And we're wondering about his career journey.

Interviewer 18:37
And what are some of your favorite aspects or parts of your job or projects you've worked on or anything like that?

Jose Ybarra 18:37
I love the kids that I work with. And it's they're amazing people. They have taught me so much. I've learned that I don't have slaps Thank you. I don't have good music. And if I get too mad at them, they go don't get booty tickled. Like butt hurt. I'm like, Oh my gosh, I am so thoughtful. Say you're so old. Like yeah, I am. You know, there's so much fun to hang out with. You know, we were at the pools yesterday, we were playing football in the pools, and they were still throwing it at me or they'd still, you know, the kids for years past love to jump on me and try to drown me. It's like their favorite pastime. Like let's all get Jose and drown him. And I'm like, No, I'm gonna go to the deep end now. Yeah, so that's the kids.

Interviewer 19:34
And you mentioned that you had worked at footlocker right. Oh, yeah. I'm curious. Worse. Wow. What were you like when you were a teenager?

Jose Ybarra 19:46
You know, I I want to say that my youthfulness has been a little tainted. My father passed away when I was very young. And then my mother actually went into the hospital my junior year of high school. And we owned a family business. So I worked in the family business and there was no other person. So it was me there with my other brothers. And so I grew up kind of fast. You know, my, my teenage years, I never thought I had friends. And it was quite surprising because my mom actually got out of the hospital that day of my graduation from high school. And I thought, you know, because I've worked so hard and just kind of gave up on my friends that that would be it. But I got a standing ovation from my whole entire class. And it was like it was, you know, people I didn't even know just knew about me kind of just having to deal with so much I and I loved every minute of

Interviewer 20:43
that. But do you remember what your first day in the job was like? Well, when

Jose Ybarra 20:48
I first started for Mercy Housing, I started at a senior site. And so very different. Very different. Yeah. And I remember, the first thing I had to do was a Christmas party, because that's how I came in during Christmas time. I started in December. And I remember thinking, Oh, my God, I don't know what I'm doing here. Like, it was really hard for me and I had to cook and I was, you know, and I love to cook. But like when you're cooking for, for a lot of a lot of people, you're like, oh God, do I know how to make all this? So that first year, I was like, Mom, come help me. So she came in, like, she's like, it's gonna be okay. Miho this is what you have to do get a sack from Costco of potatoes and like the sack. You got a lot of people dude, like, okay, it's, you know, that's my first memories is like, freaking out over the Christmas party. But yeah,

# EARLY LIFE

Interviewer 21:43
What was the transition like, from working with seniors to you? It's

Jose Ybarra 21:47
the exact same, it really is. Because for people to meet you, you know, again, in the senior site, there used to predominantly women that have helped them out. So for a man come in and listen to us, you know, people with their stories, and they, they weren't really approachable at first. And unfortunately, I didn't have that much time at the senior site, because I got placed at the family site right away. Yeah, it was within half a year. Wow. Yeah.

# ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND AWARDS

Interviewer 22:17
And then in 2018, you won the Be the Difference Award for your work with Kassa. Can you tell us more about how you got that award and what Casa is,

Jose Ybarra 22:26
CASA is Court Appointed Special Advocates. So I volunteer with them once a week, and I take a kid out that has been either abused or neglected or something has happened that has triggered the court to get involved. And so I was nominated by Casa themselves. They right into the volunteer center and, and my work with the kids. And I believe it was because of my work with this one kid who gets carsick really badly, but really wanted to go to the San Francisco Zoo. I remember us having to pull over a lot of times, and for him to be okay, and then just go and then it was an amazing trip. It was so much fun. He was so ecstatic when we got there because I have friends that live out in San Francisco who work at a farmers market. So they gave them cherries. And he was like, I didn't know how badly he loved cherries. He grabbed like a huge sack for which I was like, Dude, he's got to sell some he's given them to me, I'm taken. Like, okay, you know, and we went to the zoo afterwards. And it was just a blast. And and I was one of many people that were given that honor and have been joined everything I've done, actually, yeah.

Interviewer 23:41
Is there an accomplishment in particular that you're proud of? That's

Jose Ybarra 23:48
a word that that I had no idea. I got nominated for it. And I got an email saying, hey, you've been nominated for this. My proudest moment is my my resident graduating Santa Barbara. UC Santa Barbara key has decided that he wants to be a social worker that works with kids as well. So when he called me to tell me that I cried, you know, it's just you know, I made a difference in his life and I'm really happy about that. I you know, yeah,

# WORKING WITH STUDENTS

Interviewer 24:22
Did you help guide him towards like UCSB like did you help them apply? Or was that all kind of was

Jose Ybarra 24:26
all him? Oh, yeah. He, he went, he's awesome. It's a really he's an actual really interesting story. He, he got hit by a car. And they, they, in talking to his father didn't give him more than 1% chance of life. And he, he beat everything. And he went to Cabrillo College because he knew he couldn't go straight to you know, and he did everything he had to do at Cabrillo. And then he took off and he would call me and tell me hey, or email me Hey, I got stuff. A Sir Hey, I did this. I'm like, great job. And he also called me one day, you know, Jose, I just don't have food. And I was like, Okay, I will help you with that. Let's get you CalFresh. And, and so I helped him out with that. And, and I remember he called me and said, Jose, I'm given up on school. And so what's going on dude? And he sat there talking to me about it. And I'm like, Well, what do you? Here's where here's, you know, because, you know, I say I'm invested. And then And then sometimes I just don't know. But I go, so what are you trying to get your degree and it just popped in my head to ask? Because, oh, I want to be a social worker and work with kids. I'm saying

Jose Ybarra 25:45
Oh, help you. So, you know, I tell them go volunteer at places out there that you know, with kids and so he, he was like, Okay, I'll do that. And he said, Dude, that was such great, you know, that reaffirmed what I want to do. And, and yeah, and he invited me to his graduation, and I will go and I went and I was so proud of him. And yeah, it's been an amazing feeling. It was yeah, it was a great feeling, you know, and he approached me gave me a hug. And he said, This is because uh, you and all your hard work. It's not because of you.

# WORKING WITH RESIDENTS

Interviewer 26:18
Yeah, well, how many people do you say that you work with, like on a daily basis or just in, in your work life

Jose Ybarra 26:25
in my work life? Well, I work with our residents, which is 60 units, and anywhere from one to like, six people living in in any of the units, we have one to five bedrooms. I also work with my staff, Mark community partners. You know, I also work with drawbridge who does art classes for our kids and, you know, the parks, lifeguards at swimming pools, I deal with them as well. So I deal with a lot and I've worked with a lot of people and you know, have a lot of great connections throughout the whole entire community.

# ADVICE FOR ASPIRING SOCIAL WORKERS

Interviewer 27:02
What advice would you give to someone who's interested in pursuing social work?

Jose Ybarra 27:02
My advice would be you're gonna go through lots of ups and downs, but don't harbor on the downs. Just keep going with your apps where I feel I messed up, I have made sure that it doesn't happen again. Just keep focusing on the positives. I mean, this kid is a positive, you know, my future kids are going to be the positive.

# PARTING THOUGHTS

Jose Ybarra 27:29
I always love to say have fun. I'm blasting music in my office and singing and if I'm off key, I don't care. I'm gonna do it anyways. But it's it's if people see you having fun with what you do, they're a lot less stressed. They're a lot less you know, like coming in like, I gotta go tell them something that's hard now if they see you like being cheerful and, and having an open door policy, really to anything and everybody you know, no judgments. Let's say you Emily do something to me wrong me so bad today. But tomorrow, I'm gonna still come in with that smile, like, Hey, how are you doing Emily not have like that. That hint of like, Oh, you are horrible person typing. And that's really made a difference for all the resumes because they're used to being treated a certain way. And so I don't treat them that way.
