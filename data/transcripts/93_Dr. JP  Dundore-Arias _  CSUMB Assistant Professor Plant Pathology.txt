#INTRODUCTION

Interviewer  0:15  
Hello and welcome everyone to KS QD Santa Cruz app. 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and you're listening to our show what to be where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers, but to be as a program provided by your future as our business, the Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, panels and other work based learning activities. Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those natural bridges, media, or your futures or business. The information provided during this program does not reflect its career in its entirety. And today, I have the pleasure of speaking with Dr. JP Dunder Arias, who is an assistant professor of plant pathology in the Department of Biology and Chemistry at California State University of Monterey Bay. Thanks for being here. JP, I really appreciate it.

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  1:08  
It's my pleasure to be here.

#EARLY LIFE

Interviewer  1:10  
Thank you. JP, would you mind briefly explaining how you got into this field and your career journey?

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  1:18  
Yeah, I would describe my career journey as what some would call it. Unconventional or non traditional. I, I was born and raised in Costa Rica. And I come from a family that where I was the first to attend college. So I never had any really an exposure or the desire to become a scientist until later in the high school. And at that time, I what I wanted to become was an agronomist, because I wanted to work in agriculture, which is a for all of you who are listening agriculture is is after tourism, the main economical activity in Costa Rica. So I went to college to the university that of Costa Rica in obtained my bachelor's degree in agronomy, and my plan was to get out of college and go straight into the workforce. 

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  2:21  
So after graduation, I actually started working as a fresh produce grower, and growing and selling vegetables at a local farmers market. And at the end of my graduate school, I had the opportunity to participate in an exchange program with his students from Iowa State University and University of Costa Rica, and they came to visit my farm or not to my farm because we didn't own it, but the plots that we have when we were growing our vegetables. When we were hosting those students and the professor from Iowa State University, I was trying to explain my my experience in what we were doing. And what was unique about we were trying to do at our farm was we were trying to implement integrated pest management strategies. Trying to use the knowledge that we obtained from the classroom, and from our courses into play to apply that into the production of that of the properties that we were growing in. 

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  3:34  
During that visit and had the opportunity to speak with Professor from Iowa State University, who came to me and asked me if I was if I have consider going into grad school. And at that time, I explained to him that I didn't know, I was not considering grad school, I didn't know what grad school was. And I didn't have the economical capacity to go to grad school, let alone go outside of the country. He started explaining this idea or these opportunities that there were for students like myself, international or national or domestic students, where you could obtain either scholarships or fellowships to pay for your graduate program while conducting research. So you become a research associate and the work that you're doing on a research project that becomes your thesis. And this sounds really, almost like a scripted or plan, but I can assure you that it was nothing like that back then. I didn't even speak English. He didn't speak very well Spanish. So somehow we were able to communicate in a very broken Spanglish. But he wanted that conversation to have an impact on myself and to introduce me to something that I have never considered and give it that motivation that perhaps he was seeing something in me I still don't know. And I have asked him after many years later, what it was that he saw in me that made him ask that question. And he said that there was not one thing, it was just the whole package. But for myself, it gave me that motivation to start learning more about it, do some opportunities. And that's how I ended up applying to Iowa State University. And I was able to get in to be accepted. 

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  5:29  
I completed my master's degree at Iowa State to studying sea borne diseases of soybean, which when I was thinking back in Costa Rica, what can I do with this degree because in Costa Rica, we don't grow soybeans. And my plan was to go to Iowa State completed my master's and then go back to Costa Rica. And then when I was in Iowa, one thing led to the other one, I had a wonderful experience there. I had a great mentor that later became a close friend of mine, who encouraged me to continue my my career and pursue my, my PhD, and I had the opportunity to go to the University of Wisconsin Madison, where I completed my PhD in plant pathology, this time is studying human pathogens, foodborne pathogens like E. coli and salmonella and tariqa, that contaminate planet. So my PhD program was looking at how this bacterial pathogens colonized letters. After that, I knew that with a PhD, I was more on the track of academic career. So then I was able to go to the University of Minnesota and with the support of the postdoctoral fellowship from the National Science Foundation, I was able to do a postdoc, and there I was studying soil microorganisms in this microbial community and how this contributes to soil health. 

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  6:56  
And then it was time for me, after so many years in the university, to start looking for jobs and this opportunity came up. For me that was very interesting because it allowed me to combine two of my passions, which are teaching and also doing research in close proximity with the industry. And that's why it's so unique of this position here at CSUMB. Because we have a great student body and the university has great connections and impacts on the community, especially training underrepresented students, but also we have close connections with our agriculture industry in the Salinas Valley. So that was really a wonderful opportunity for me and I was I applied for a job and, I got it. 

Interviewer  7:49  
That is a really interesting story. Thank you for sharing that JP. And I've just heard the greatest things about Costa Rica, the people and the culture down there. Have a bunch of buddies who go down there, they fly into San Jose, and they love surfing this surf spot called witch's rock. I'm not sure if you've heard of that spot. It's I've seen pictures and just looks gorgeous. I was wondering, was it a bit of a culture shock moving to the Midwest and experiencing winter? 

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  8:17  
Coming from Costa Rica, a cultural shock, would be an understatement. I arrived in Iowa by myself on a cold January. I have never been to Pittsburgh with a winter outside of the country. So it was the first time for me to see snow and experiencing that kind of weather or climate situation. I was not prepared, they didn't have the right climate and anything else. But at the same time, as much as I was unprepared, I was so fortunate to meet wonderful people that have helped me adjust and adapt to that process because it was hard not only the culture shock and living in Iowa, which is a very non diverse place. But also it was a very small town where the university campus is which is completely different to where I come from in Costa Rica. I come from the capital sound hotel which is it's a really small country but San Jose is a big city. So I was it was a cultural shock there but again by making friends that become almost like your immediate family was what allowed me to to push through and overcome some of these challenges.

#EDUCATION INVOLVEMENT

Interviewer  9:46  
Well, that's That's awesome that you were able to make the best of it and maybe with the weather being like that and being a small town it made it easier to stay indoors and study too. JP, Would you mind telling us what some of your main duties and responsibilities are as an assistant professor?

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  10:04  
Yeah, so. So CSUMB is primarily undergraduate teaching institution. So we're a four year college, we have several different bachelor's programs, as well as few master's programs. But we don't grant PhDs because we're a state college. So we are one of the 23 campuses of the California State system. As part of my job, my main duty is to teach courses.I teach courses both in their biology major, as well as the new program that we just launched in fall 2020, called the agricultural Plant and Soil Science major. So in industry progress in the biology and the agricultural program, I teach courses that are related to, of course, Plant Pathology, as well as biotechnology, managed crop management, insects that are passive crops and other themes, mycology, bacterial DNA and other topics. In addition to teaching courses, one of my duties is to mentor and train students. So we do that through either professional mentoring, where students have questions about career paths, or whether they should go to grad school or do an internship, things like that. We the faculty at CSUMB have a strong commitment. And we have an open door policy where we work very closely with students offering that kind of advice or mentoring, but also we train them in research and are allowing them to gain research skills in the laboratory. So not only in courses that have labs, but also for example, I have my own lab plant pathology lab where we conduct research, and we're able to have students participating in that research in all the research that I do in my laboratory is related to diseases of crops that are grown here in the Salinas or pahar, barley, primarily strawberries, letters, onions and other crops. 

Interviewer  12:22  
I would imagine that agriculture is a popular field of study due to the proximity to the Salinas Valley, is that correct? Yes,

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  12:28  
Well, it's a new program. As a matter of fact, myself and my colleague, we were hired last year to develop and launch this program. So we started in 2019. And we launched or accepted the first cohort of students in fall 2020. The program so far is, it's going great,  there is definitely great interest among students, because at the moment, there was no other option in the Tri County region that offers a similar bachelor's degree for students. So any students that were interested in bachelor's degree in agriculture, they needed to go to other campuses that were a little farther away. So this opportunity is or this program is allowing the students to remain in the area, perhaps we may keep their jobs and be part time students or they stayed at home, so they don't have to deal with the burden of financial aid, and in other cases, just to stay at home, because, you know, this is the place that they identified as home and where they want to stay.

Interviewer  13:40  
Okay, I'm a little bit surprised that there wasn't more of an opportunity to pursue a bachelor's degree in agriculture, especially where we live. And JP, would you mind telling us what a day or week looks like for you? And in that maybe has changed with COVID right now and distance learning?

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  14:00  
Yes. So back to your first point, yet. The reason is, we are really we're actually one of the newest campuses in the California State University system, where last year it was our 25 years anniversary. And originally, this was a campus that was primarily associated with the ocean. So marine science is one of the strongest programs here at CSUMB. But with the arrival of of new people and new leadership to the campus, they have brought different ideas and they certainly have identified that we were missing out by not taking advantage of our geographic location. And the fact that we have the pool of students in the area, particularly in Salinas that are having strong connections, personal family or even professional relationships with the industry. They were interested in pursuing that kind of degree. The local community colleges offer relevant degrees, but that is only a two year degree and not the 401. So the way that we're working our program, we're offering the program both as a four year standalone program at CSUMB. But also as a two plus two program where students that have completed their agricultural program at local community colleges, then can transfer to AWS and in two years complete their bachelor's degree. 

Interviewer  14:22  
Okay, thanks for explaining that. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the what to be show at que es que de Santa Cruz 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart, and I'm speaking with Dr. JP Dunder Arias, who is a plant pathologist at California State University of Monterey Bay. And JP I was wondering, what are some of your favorite projects you've worked on and or are currently working on yet.

#AGRICULTURAL PROJECTS AND CAREER

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  15:58  
So, we have in terms of research program, we have a few that are again related to diseases of locally grown crops, the main project that we have going on is studying a disease that affects letters is called Pythian wilt is caused by an oh my seat pathogen, that in fact, the plants end up remaining standing with dead roots that are compelling necrotic wood rot in tissues. So, the plants are unable to obtain the water from the soil or any kind of nutrients. So the plants either remain stunted, or they end up wilting due to whenever the temperatures start increasing in primarily in in the summer and fall season. 

Interviewer  16:52  
And we were talking a little bit before the interview and you're telling me that that plants can transfer bacteria to animals and to people like maybe mushrooms that are grown in grain that are then fed to animals or things like E coli, maybe would you mind explaining how that works to us? 

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  17:12  
Yeah, there there are two things here. So there are Pathak plant pathogens that can produce compounds that are toxic for either animals or humans. So the pathogens can effect, for example, corn, grains under storage conditions, these molds are growing on these grains and producing these toxins that when the grains are going through the mill and they're grounded, they're used for either any human or food products or animal food products. When we consume those animals that have that food, we can develop some potential health issues because of the toxic compounds. So this is a huge problem. For example, in corn, in parts of the world that eat tortillas made out of ground corn directly from from the grain and if the grains again are contaminated, that is a direct source of contamination for the people eating those tortillas. The same with animal feed, if the materials that are used for making that food are contaminated then the animals can develop some health issues. 

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  18:27  
So in addition to the toxic compounds produced by plant pathogens, there are human pathogens like E. coli, and salmonella that some people in the audience might have heard that are often linked to outbreaks of foodborne illness associated with with consumption of contaminated foods like romaine lettuce or spinach or other produce. These are human pathogens that don't have the capacity to make plants sick so they are not a plant pathogen. So the plants don't develop symptoms, the plants are not going to change the way that they grow, or the way that they look because of this presence of these human pathogens. But this human pathogens can colonize the exterior of the plants or take advantage of wounds or any kind of openings and get inside of the plant. And then when we as humans or animals consume contaminated plants, in the particular case of E coli, we can we can get really sick and develop really severe ill illness conditions. Particularly with more pathogenic strains it can lead to even the development of kidney failure and some major tragic situations. So it's not a matter of just getting sick in terms of having diarrhea or the traditional food poisoning, in some cases could be very serious.

Interviewer  20:02  
So the plants can transmit different pathogens to us. But is it possible for humans to transmit pathogens or bacteria back to the plants?

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  20:12  
That's an excellent observation. So we cannot. So human pathogens cannot make plants sick the same way that plant pathogens cannot make humans sick. That being said, humans are a huge source of pathogens to plants, because we can carry pathogens that are attached to our clothes, attached to our boots if we go to the field, and attached to machinery, trucks, tractors or any kind of tools that we use in the field. So you could transmit pathogens from one field to the other one. What you want to be able to do is if you have a cold and then you go touch a lettuce plant, that lettuce plant will not get the virus or the pathogens that is making you sick. But we are able to actually transmit and carry with us pathogens that might be a problem for for plants. That is a huge problem. That is one of the reasons why when you go to the airport, they always ask, Are you bringing any plants or they check you in certain ways to make sure that you're not bringing organisms that might be present in other parts of the world, but they have not yet been introduced here in the US, for example.

Interviewer  21:31  
That makes total sense. And JP, would you mind telling us what your favorite or most rewarding part of your job is?

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  21:40  
The most rewarding part of my job would have be the interaction with the students. I have been able to witness the huge impact that close mentoring and understanding can have in some of our students in the classroom setting. Sometimes it's really hard to understand the conditions, the students living situation, or what is their current situation and things that they might be going through and how that affects their performance in the classroom. So it's sometimes it's really hard to grasp what their motivations are, or what their interests are, but when you're working with them in a research setting, is when you start seeing a more one on one interaction, that they they are very capable. All our local students surprise me tremendously of how talented they are, and how passionate and motivated they are to support our local agriculture industry. So that is that I would say that that is the most rewarding, is to see in those students something that perhaps was what that person saw in me many years ago. So now I have the opportunity to identify those students and introduce them to opportunities that perhaps they haven't considered yet. And I could be a source of that information, provide that mentoring. So in a way, it is now my duty to pass the baton and and keep recruiting more students to join the workforce.

#ADVICE AND TAKEAWAYS

Interviewer  23:16  
Oh, I think that's really beautiful JP. And that kind of leads me into my next question. I think I have time for a couple more, maybe two, what advice or resources can you give to students who are interested in pursuing this career?

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  23:29  
I would say that, first of all, think broadly. I always start my classes showing all the students that graduate in the United States. When you ask the students, a huge percent of them, they want to go into the medical field, and for many reasons, but there is only so many limited opportunities within those fields because they're so crowded. And there might be other fields where the students can do very similar work. And instead of becoming a doctor of human health, they can become for example, a doctor in plant pathology or doctor in Marine Science, doctor in any other programs. So I would say that they have to push themselves and think outside of the box, think outside of what they see on TV and what they have grown up being told that they should become because especially in agriculture, even though we they might have a very narrow idea of what agricultural work is based on personal experiences or driving around and seeing the farm workers working very hardly in the field, it's a very physical and tedious job and definitely very, not a well rewarded. But in agriculture now there's also an revolution going on and there's a massive amount of, of technology that has been incorporated in automatic technologies, in the use of different biotechnology tools, so people that have the right skill sets can incorporate that kind of knowledge and opportunities to this to offer them to the agriculture industry to enhance and improve the way that we grow food and the way that we also treat the environment to make sure that we grow our food in a more sustainable way.

#OUTRO

Interviewer  25:36  
Thank you, JP, and are there any last things that you would like to share with us?

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  25:42  
I would say that, for all the folks that are listening, I would say do not hesitate to contact people, you may not be sure what you want to do, you might not be sure of how to start, where to start, where to put your eggs, right. And often the students make the mistake of putting all their eggs in one basket and that basket breaks, then it takes it takes longer and in more work to recoup and start working again on that life project. So I would say do your best to expose yourself and have the opportunity to be introduced to different disciplines, talk to different people, even though you might know what you want to become, you might end up elsewhere. And I that's the reason what I always like to share my personal experience because I was in the same shoes many years ago when I thought that I wanted to be a farmer. I wanted to be a grower working in the fields. And I was able to do that. But I was also unaware of some other opportunities. And when this opportunities were made available to myself, I realized that those were really where my passions belonged. 

Interviewer  27:04  
I think that's very sound advice and having an open mind about your education and in life. And, again, I want to thank you, JP, for taking the time to do this interview.

Dr. JP Dunder Arias  27:15
