# Introduction
[00:00:00] Interviewer: 
Hello, and welcome everyone to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90. 7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart, and you're listening to our show, What to Be, where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What to Be is a program provided by your Futures or Business. A Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, panels, and other work based learning activities.
Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of Natural Bridges Media or Your Future is Our Business. The information provided during this program does not reflect its career in its entirety. And today I have the pleasure to speak to Reina Chalise, who's an instructor of communication studies at Cabrillo College.
Hi, Raina. 


[00:01:03] Raina Chelise: 
Patrick. Thank you so much for having me.
 
[00:01:06] Interviewer: 
Oh, you're very welcome. And thank you very much for taking the time to, to join us and be on the show tonight. I really appreciate it.
 
[00:01:12] Raina Chelise: 
Oh, I'm so thrilled. 


# Career Journey
[00:01:13] Interviewer: 
Thank you. Raina, would you please describe your career journey for us?
 
[00:01:18] Raina Chelise: 
Oh my gosh. Yes. It's quite the adventure.
Awesome. So I, yeah, I started out at Curb Your College as a first generation student. You know, I, I didn't really know how college worked. I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I was intrigued by college. So I started out at Cabrillo and I took so many different kinds of courses from hydroponics to well being to Hatha yoga.
Um, and eventually I was told that I needed to take what they call GE credits general education. And I later learned that that also meant having to take com one public speaking. Which I thought, you know, was my end. I thought, okay, well, this is how I'm going to die. I have to deliver a speech to my peers.
But you know, I actually ended up falling in love with the communication process and really recognizing the power in public speaking. So from there, really, I just went on to take as many communication studies courses as I could. And actually my professor Charlotte Morrison at Cabrillo pulled me aside in her office and said, you know, Raina, have you ever thought about becoming an educator?
And I laughed at her because I thought she was kidding. Um, but it turns out she wasn't. So she was the first person to really believe that I could do something like that. And so, you know, she inspired me to go on and earn my bachelor's from CSU Stanislaus and my master's from San Jose state. Um, And then I came back and I'm now a full time, um, educator in the communication studies department at Cabrillo.
So it's, it's really come full circle. It's been a dream come true because, you know, I never fathomed going into Cabrillo as a student that this is how it would have turned out. So I'm, I'm really fortunate and just so grateful to be here. 


# First Gen Student and Higher Education Pursuit
[00:03:15] Interviewer: 
Well, congratulations and, and for sharing your inspirational story about being a first generation college graduate and for all those listening who might be intimidated, you know, by going to school or anything, you know, thank you for showing that it can be done, you know, 


[00:03:33] Raina Chelise: 
Oh, absolutely. And I think, you know, coming into a college classroom, I wasn't entirely convinced that I had anything of value to contribute. Um, and it was teachers like Charlotte or Dan Rothwell or, you know, so many others at Cabrillo that told me and really showed me that my voice and my experiences and cultural background, it all matters in the learning process.
So I just hope whoever might be listening, if you're a first generation student wondering if you're valuable in the classroom, the answer is yes, and we need your voice.
 
[00:04:07] Interviewer: 
Yeah. So 


[00:04:08] Raina Chelise: I
'm just, I'm happy to share that message.
 
[00:04:11] Interviewer: 
Absolutely. And, and also, I just think it's so important. It sounds like you found a mentor and just, I think that's kind of an invaluable for a lot of us.
For me, it was, you know, and it sounds like for you too, right? 


[00:04:23] Raina Chelise: Absolutely. You know, just recognizing that learning is so incredibly relational, at least for me, it was, you know, meeting people like Charlotte and just having that mentor relationship. And then I went on at my other. Universities to recognize that there's these incredible people that we can learn from and with and they really shaped my entire career path 


[00:04:45] Interviewer: 
Yeah, and you're continuing your education.
Is that right? You're going for your PhD in education? 


[00:04:51] Raina Chelise: 
Yes, so I am going back for I suppose they call it the Edd, right? So it's that doctorate in education specifically educational leadership Um, so yeah, I, I'm back at CSU Stanislaus, you know, and it's a intensive three year program. But basically it's for transformative educational leaders to come in and recognize the different leverage points that we can start to change things.


[00:05:20] Interviewer: 
That is so great. And in reading your bio, do you want to tell us about your background in being a radio broadcaster? And it sounds like you narrated a book. That sounds awesome. Awesome. 


[00:05:30] Raina Chelise: 
Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's been such a journey just recognizing the power of voice and recognizing how our narratives are really powerful tools to better understand ourselves and each other and even our society.
So, for me, you know, starting out at Cabrillo, I was actually recommended to start to work at KUSP, which, you know, from what I understand, that was originally what, you know, K Squid started out as. Um, so I was encouraged to go and, and produce for KUSP to create first person singular, um, sessions, you know, with different community members.
And from there, I was able to really learn that it's important to share our stories because we have a lot to learn from each other. So from there, from KUSP, I then went on to earn my bachelor's at CSU Stanislaus and work for KCSS, which is their radio station on the campus. So I was able to, um, create podcast sessions, like Meet the Professor, where it's dialogues to just get to know educators on the campus, um, and also to be the campus representative at KCSS, so really strengthening connections across the university.
And, um, yeah, just, it was very cool to be able to have my own radio show. I have my Modern Rec, um, window of time each week. So it's been just a really amazing ride to start to better understand the ways that we can continue growing as narrators and also learning from each other's stories as well.
 
[00:07:10] Interviewer: 
Oh my gosh. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like a lot of fun. And on top of that, you had a music show that you were doing every week too.
 
[00:07:17] Raina Chelise: 
Yes. Yeah. It was called Raina's modern rock block. Yeah.
 
[00:07:23] Interviewer: 
Awesome. Do you want to Talk about, you know, your, your job at Cabrillo and like what your main duties and responsibilities are and, and when did you start at Cabrillo?


[00:07:34] Raina Chelise: 
Yeah, so I started at Cabrillo shortly after graduating from San Jose State, probably, gosh, it must have been back in 2018.
 
[00:07:42] Interviewer: 
Okay. 


[00:07:43] Raina Chelise: 
Um, and you know, it, I started out as an adjunct, right, a part timer. And then from there I went to temporary full time, and then I interviewed and got the tenure track position.


[00:07:53] Interviewer: 
Oh, congratulations. 


#ONLINE EDUCATION TRANSITION
[00:07:54] Raina Chelise: 
Thank you so much. Yeah, it's, it's just been pretty interesting to see all the different stages of what it means to be an educator, and, you know, I'm always becoming in that way.
 
[00:08:04] Interviewer: 
Mm hmm. 


[00:08:04] Raina Chelise: 
So, um, yeah, at Cabrillo, I am currently teaching five different classes. Three of them are fully online.
Um, and it's, it's really just an opportunity for me and a total honor to be able to walk through the students through the communication process and across my different classes. I teach public speaking, intercultural communication, small group discussion. So it's really just inviting students into the knowledge creation process and for us to really collectively explore.
What does it mean to be an effective, thoughtful communicator in this world? 


[00:08:44] Interviewer: 
Yeah, that sounds, those sound like fabulous classes and having three of those online. Does that make it manageable? I mean, it just sounds like you'd be very busy, right? With five classes. 


[00:08:54] Raina Chelise: 
It is. It's so busy. And, you know, I think with the pandemic, it's changed so many people's lives.
Um, And for me, it's, it's changed the way that I think about teaching as well, because my three classes are what they call asynchronous, which means that I create these lecture videos and these, you know, dynamic different assignments, and then students move through them at their own pace each week. Um, so it's, it's been interesting because starting out as a teacher, you know, back in 2018, or even before that at San Jose state as a graduate student, I had my own classes.
I never considered online teaching. So, yeah, I've become an online educator and I'm proud to say that and it's also helped me see how many different ways you can approach the learning process.
 
[00:09:42] Interviewer: 
So you have your online curriculum, do you use any of that for your, for your in person classes to like supplement, you know, if people might miss a class or if they need, they want to go back over what may have been covered for that class?


[00:09:59] Raina Chelise: 
Well, I love that question. I've actually this semester started doing what they call flipped classrooms, so I've been able to use some of those lecture videos before the class starts each week. So students have this opportunity to really engage in the reading and the lectures, and then they show up to class in person ready to engage actively in the learning process.
So, um, it's been really interesting to be able to see students, you know, revisit materials as they need to each week. And then when we're in person, we do activities, we do presentations, we have conversations. So yeah, they're able to use those materials now that I know how to make them. It's pretty cool.


[00:10:42] Interviewer: 
Yeah. And I love that. Like when I have teachers who will post, and it seems like often that's happening, they'll post the lecture, you know, after class or the slides at least, you know, for reviewing maybe for like an exam or whatever.
 
[00:10:54] Raina Chelise: 
Absolutely, and I've actually been enjoying creating what I'm calling co created pages in Canvas as our learning management system.


[00:11:02] Interviewer: 
Okay. 


[00:11:03] Raina Chelise: 
Um, so they can watch the video and then the next page that they explore, they can edit and then change the material on that page so they can talk about, you know, any questions that came up for them or what they thought of or how it relates to their everyday lives.
 
[00:11:18] Interviewer: 
So, yeah, did, did Cabrillo help you figure out how to create your online courses or was that on you?
How does that work? 


[00:11:27] Raina Chelise: 
Yeah, it was a little bit of both. Cabrillo had this incredible summer opportunity called the DE Academy, which is the Distance Education Academy. Um, and basically they walked us through over the summer how to create things like pages on Canvas, how to record your own videos and then later caption them for our students who need to be able to see what we're saying instead of just listening.
So I was able to use the DE learning that I did over that summer and then from there I've done a lot of like individual or independent exploration of how to grow from there.
 
[00:12:06] Interviewer: 
Okay, and it must be nice, you know, being back in person, right? I think Cabrillo delayed their going fully back a little bit longer than UCSC did?


[00:12:17] Raina Chelise: 
It's true, yeah, we um, we've been fluctuating between, you know, staying fully online, moving in person, and I know students have, you know, gotten caught in that process, but I think in so many ways it's just, you know, valuable to be in person you know, just for even take activities, for example, we're able to really be in a space together, even be outside and have in person conversations.
It's been very helpful to be able to do that again.
 
[00:12:45] Interviewer: 
Yeah. And I agree that, you know, with the online platform, it might Make it easier to go back to school for a lot of people. But with that, right, you have all the distractions of being at home.
 
[00:12:57] Raina Chelise: 
I think that's true.
And it's, you know, learning how to teach online, learning what it means to be an online educator. I'm also starting to see that. It's allowed so many students who, you know, aren't able to come to these in person classes to continue pursuing their degree, you know, even if it's a parent who works full time and can only learn, you know, maybe in the middle of the night or after their kids have gone to bed.
I'm just seeing that there's so many different opportunities when we have both kinds of modalities in place. 


[00:13:29] Interviewer: 
Yeah, and it seemed like there was a lot of talk about, you know, how the, the students are suffering during, you know, over the last couple years, but I felt like there wasn't enough emphasis on, like, how are the teachers doing too, you know, because they're isolated and it must be hard to teach.
A lot of them never considered teaching on an online platform when they became teachers. So it must have been really difficult, I think, for some, and I don't, I think some just couldn't do it. You know, weren't up to it or whatever, but, you know, definitely grateful for, you know, all the teachers like you who, um, you know, it sounds like you're just doing a great job.


[00:14:03] Raina Chelise: 
Oh my gosh. Well, thank you. And you know, it was a real struggle. I think that, well, at least I didn't expect it to happen so quickly. You know, we, I saw my students one week and then the next week we were fully online because of the pandemic and we didn't get to see each other again for the rest of the semester.
Um, so just a really strange experience of. Abruptly becoming that online educator that I never pictured myself to be. Um, and you know, it's, it was really important to have my learning community alongside me in those moments because I was able to sit down and even like with Charlotte, you know, she's the reason I'm a teacher and we sat down and learned how to teach online together.
So I think that that sense of community has been so important.
 
# MAIN DUTIES AS AN EDUCATOR
[00:14:52] Interviewer: 
Yeah. And do you want to talk about some of your just main duties and responsibilities, you know, as a teacher? 


[00:15:00] Raina Chelise: 
Yeah, sure. So I think so much of it has been, you know, not only creating lessons that invite students into the learning process, but then to offer really meaningful feedback to them once they've engaged in these different learning opportunities.
So, for me, you know, a typical week, I start out on Monday and I, I go and teach. And then from there, while I'm in office hours, I respond to at least, you know, half a million emails. That's a big part of it. Um, but then once you get past the emails, you can start to really dive into what the students have submitted in terms of, you know, the things they've learned about how this relates to their everyday lives and how they want to continue learning these new ideas.
Um, so giving feedback on Canvas, for me anyways, I typically do audio feedback, so I record my voice, or I do a lot of written feedback, or I just connect with them and say, you know, here's what I got from your, your work, and here's what was really amazing for me, and then here's some things to think about moving forward.
Um, so yeah, and then beyond that, I try and think of new activities that. can engage students even further in active learning. So we do a lot of, um, art based projects. We made Pandemic Pet Rocks not too long ago together. Um, so I do a lot of play based learning, which is what I'm working on for my, my doctoral degree as well.
Um, so really just emphasizing that it's important to play together, especially in the community college classroom with adult learners. I think we forget how to play. So. A lot of my everyday duties is really emphasizing how can I invite, playfully, all of these different incredible people in my classroom to engage in these different questions with me.


[00:16:48] Interviewer: 
Oh, I think that's great. And yeah, I think it's important, right, to create that kind of atmosphere that helps, you know, I think it helps the students a lot to learn. 


[00:16:57] Raina Chelise: 
I think so, especially when we consider the apprehension they come into the communication classroom with. I think public speaking is one of the, probably the scariest classes you have to take as a college student.
Um, and arguably, probably one of the most important classes too. 


[00:17:15] Interviewer: 
Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. And for all those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the What to Be show on KSQD Santa Cruz, 90. 7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and I'm speaking with Reina Chalise, who's an instructor of communication studies at Cabrillo College.


# SKILL UTILIZED ON THE JOB
[00:17:33] Interviewer: 
Reina, do you want to talk about some of the skills you use in your career and what you And how did you acquire these skills? Was it, you know, through life or through education? 


[00:17:42] Raina Chelise: 
Absolutely. So I think one of the biggest ones that comes to mind is just a sense of adaptability. Um, and for me, that came from growing up with my, you know, beautifully nomadic mother and my sisters.
Um, but just really recognizing that we need to always be flexible and ready to adapt to Any given circumstance. So really having that, that situational sensibility about things that it's important to realize the context, the history, everything that students are bringing into the classroom needs to be able to change the learning environment if needed.
So I think adaptability is a big one. And then beyond that, just a willingness to listen. And that's been, you know, directly connected to communication studies because we, we teach listening and listening to something we do most of the time, but it's something we probably talk about the least amount regarding communication.
So besides adaptability and listening, I would say just a willingness to engage in open ended dialogue. Um, and again, that's definitely communication related, but also just recognizing how important relationships are in the learning space. Um, and I learned all of that from my incredible mentors along the way.


[00:19:03] Interviewer: 
That's great. And do you want to elaborate on what active listening is? I hear a lot of talk about it. Is it, if you were talking to me that I'm not already planning on what I'm going to say before you stop talking?
 
[00:19:14] Raina Chelise: 
Well, that's a huge part of it. Absolutely. And just recognizing that the person may be sitting across from you or, you know online with you, like we are now.
So just recognizing that we always have something to learn from this person in front of us and it. minimizing any distractions. So recognizing that hearing and listening are two very different things. So if something is getting in the way, like noise, for example, for me, actually receiving what you're saying, that makes it very difficult to engage in that listening process, which is so internal.
Um, and hearing is often, you know, our, our ears picking up on sound, but listening is really that. inner process of deciding to engage with warm curiosity.
 
[00:20:01] Interviewer: 
Okay, that just made me think of a funny scene in a movie. I don't know if you were familiar with White Man Can't Jump.
 
[00:20:09] Raina Chelise: 
No. Okay, well, 


[00:20:11] Interviewer: 
anyways, I won't go into the story, but there's a scene in that movie where they're listening to Jimi Hendrix.
And Wesley Snipes is telling Woody Harrelson that, you know, he's like, you're listening to Jimmy, but you're talking about Jimi Hendrix, right? And you, but you're not hearing him. Um, so I think that's kind of what you were talking about.
 
[00:20:27] Raina Chelise: 
Interesting. Yeah, exactly. It's a funny, it's 


[00:20:29] Interviewer: 
a funny scene. Yeah. Very funny. Yeah.
 
[00:20:32] Raina Chelise: 
And so like you pointed out, if, if we're planning what we're saying while the person is sharing something, we're not truly listening. 


[00:20:38] Interviewer: 
Yeah. 


# CURRENT PROFESSIONAL PROJECT
[00:20:40] Interviewer: do you want to talk about some of your more favorite projects that you've worked on or are currently working on?
 
[00:20:45] Raina Chelise: 
Absolutely. So the one that I am just hopelessly devoted to is a podcast actually that I've co created alongside my friend and colleague, Nikia Chaney.
She's an English professor at Cabrillo and our brilliant student assistant Cassidy. Um, and so we, we've co created a podcast that really brings together Bye. social justice, student experience, and Black voices. Um, so for me, it's, it's leaning deeply into this process of recognizing the power of voice and creating a space in order to really engage in narrative and dialogue and explore different issues that impacts our communities of color.
So that's a big one for me. We have our, our podcast that, um, the website is amplifystudentvoices. com. And so we've, we're about a year in and we've recorded some incredible conversations. 


[00:21:41] Interviewer: 
That's great. And how often do the podcasts come out? 


[00:21:44] Raina Chelise: 
Yeah. So we aim to try and release one, one every maybe month or so.
Um, and so we're, we're working with Cabrillo students, CSUMB students, and we have some really incredible volunteers that are supporting our efforts as well.
 
[00:22:00] Interviewer: 
Yeah, that sounds like a great opportunity for somebody. 


[00:22:03] Raina Chelise: 
I think so, and, and we've even been working with students who are interested in graphic design, web design.
So I'm learning so much alongside all of these amazing people. 


[00:22:15] Interviewer: 
That's great. And so you're teaching five classes. Do you want to talk about like what kind of typical hours you work in a week? 


[00:22:23] Raina Chelise: 
Yeah. So I'm working on what they call work life balance. But, you know, I often am responding to emails from the beginning all the way to the end of the day.
But then in regards to, like, teaching in person, you know, I'm only in the classroom on Monday, Wednesdays from 930 to 1230 for two different classes. And then all the other work is really independent, working on my laptop from home or from a coffee shop or during office hours. So it really depends on, you know, the particular week and what kinds of materials I need to be creating.


[00:23:02] Interviewer: 
Okay. That makes sense. And does, how many hours a week do you think you spend like grading papers? 


[00:23:09] Raina Chelise: 
Grading papers. I've started narrowing it down because, you know, I used to write like novel length feedback. 
Um, and then I realized, you know, students of course appreciate the feedback, but sometimes they would prefer it to be a little more concise.


[00:23:23] Interviewer: 
Hmm. Okay. 


[00:23:24] Raina Chelise: 
So, I would say, you know, each week I probably grade anywhere from four to eight hours, um, across all five sections. 


[00:23:33] Interviewer: 
Okay. Yeah, for some reason I was, I thought you might say a lot more than that, but I'm, yeah, I'm sure that you're grateful it's not. 


[00:23:40] Raina Chelise: 
I mean, it used to be so much more, but I've learned how to create rubrics, which I think has helped my experience as well as my learners in the classroom as well.
So from there, you know, once you can click into the rubric, then you can give some, some concise feedback. 


[00:23:56] Interviewer: 
Yeah. Yeah. I've seen that lately too. And that definitely it's appreciated on the student end of things. 


[00:24:02] Raina Chelise: 
Absolutely. It just, I think it really helps with transparency too, because then they know exactly what it is. I'm hoping for.
 
[00:24:09] Interviewer: 
That's true. 


[00:24:10] Raina Chelise: 
Yeah. 


# WHO FITS INTO TEACHING
[00:24:11] Interviewer: 
Shalise, what kind of person do you think would enjoy becoming a teacher? 


[00:24:16] Raina Chelise: 
I think anybody who is interested in constantly Adapting to new environments, um, anybody who's interested in this incredible honoring process of watching people grow. Um, it's just, it's such a really inspiring part of the job is to offer, you know, who you are to this group of individuals and then to see them go from, you know, for example, people who are afraid of public speaking to people who are confidently willing to share their lived experiences.
So I think people who are interested in those kinds of interactions would make an incredible teacher. 


#RESOURCE INTO FIELD
[00:24:59] Interviewer: 
That sounds great. Thank you for sharing that. And what kind of advice or resources can you give to somebody who is interested in, you know, doing what you do and being a teacher like at a place like Cabrillo College?


[00:25:10] Raina Chelise: 
Yes. Great question. I would say your biggest resource is having a conversation with somebody who. Maybe is already a teacher, maybe somebody who's in school to become an educator. Um, so I would say dialogue and relationships is your biggest resource. And beyond that, just being willing to show up, even if you're scared, being willing to ask questions, even if you're worried that maybe it's a silly question or a stupid question, just being willing to Show up even if you're afraid.


[00:25:47] Interviewer: 
Okay. Yeah, that's great advice. Thank you for sharing that and you know, I'm something well You know going back to school. I never considered how great it would be communicating with my teachers You know because I I was away from school for a while. I'm going back as an adult It was really nice just to talk to teachers and about questions and about life and everything Yeah, that was like a bonus.
I didn't consider before going back. I really appreciate 


[00:26:12] Raina Chelise: 
it. Yeah, and I think you know regarding our traditional schooling system It's it's so dehumanizing because we don't think about our students as humans, right? We don't think about our teachers as people So when we really start to break down those barriers and have meaningful dialogue with each other I think that it can go really far.
It can be inspiring. 


# ADVICE FOR CAREER EXPLORATION
[00:26:32] Interviewer: 
Yeah. Thank you for sharing that in Um, do you have any advice for someone who is unsure about their career path? You 


[00:26:40] Raina Chelise: 
You know, I would say to have the courage to try something different because for me, you know, I was taking all these different classes as a student at Cabrillo and it never even occurred to me to take public speaking, which, of course, then I was forced to to transfer, but I think just that willingness to step out of your comfort zone and try something out, even if it sounds, you know, a little far fetched at first, I think that's a really important step to finding That thing that sets your whole soul on fire.
