Hi, Danielle, thank you so much for joining us today. And you know, being a part of the show, I really appreciate you being here. Danielle, would you please describe your career journey for us?


# EARLY LIFE AND PRIOR JOBS


Danielle Glagola  1:16  
So I started at Sessions actually locally here in santa cruz years back being the marketing director over there. It was an action sports apparel company. So they range anywhere from skateboards, snowboards, skis, and just so much more. They made all the apparel, but they also managed teams, so you know, different skate teams, and ski and snow teams. So my job there was really kind of all of the graphic design and the advertising to assist with apparel review the graphics for the apparel, and then we met I manage the teams there as well. So it was really fun. We got to meet a lot of great people, a lot of athletes go to events and trade shows, you know, it was a great experience. And then after that, I went over the hill to high tech, and did work there for a private company for a few years that I went into managing trade shows and events as a consultant. And then a year and a half ago, joined the Santa Cruz Metro team.


Interviewer  2:17  
Awesome. And Danielle, well, I guess let's go back to Sessions. I'm sure that Job was a lot of fun. And they probably had some like cool perks that you talked about, you know, like traveling and getting to meet a lot of professional snowboarders and skateboarders.


Danielle Glagola  2:34  
Yeah, definitely. It was a it was a great time. So we would, you know, go to the X Games, Mountain Dew games, we'd throw our own contests for riders too. And we were always participating in photoshoots. Or we go to award shows, which was great. Transworld had a bunch of events. So we would really kind of travel all across the US and then occasionally internationally.


Interviewer  2:57  
Very cool. And I think Did you go to UCSC? And did you study was marketing your major?


Danielle Glagola  3:04  
Yeah, I did go to UCSC. I did not study marketing, actually, I studied anthropology. So instead of doing that, after I graduated, I got the job at Sessions doing marketing, and just fell in love with it and just decided to kind of stay in that career.


Interviewer  3:20  
Very cool. And then then you told us that you went over the hill, and you're working in tech, that was a job at all similar to what you were doing with Sessions.


Danielle Glagola  3:28  
The workload was similar but a completely different industry. And so for them, it was entertainment technology. And so it was about streaming services. So it was you know, a really different field, but I was, you know, still involved with graphics and project management events, both like internal and external, including trade shows, website development, product marketing, you know, kind of everything under that job, anything marketing wise, you know, writing copywriting videos.


# TRANSFERRING SKILLS TO NEW JOB AT METRO


Interviewer  3:59  
Very cool. So, it sounds like you're able to use some skills that you learned while at Sessions like with that job and, and maybe has some of those from both those jobs kind of transferred to what you're doing now with the metro.


Danielle Glagola  4:12  
Yeah most definitely. Yeah, everything here at Metro, you know, I have done previously and we're just really, you know, kind of repurposing it. So a lot of advertising here at Santa Cruz Metro, we're, you know, doing videos and commercials, which, you know, I've done previously and do some, you know, social media, we have website posts. The great thing about Metro, which I didn't have at the other positions, especially the high tech was the community involvement. So really being involved with the community, getting to do outreach events, and just kind of, you know, support all of our members and riders, which is my most you know, favorite thing at Metro.


Interviewer  4:49  
Yeah that is so cool. And, you know, I think I heard some, like such positive things, you know, like a little over a year ago when the fires were unfortunately happening that the metro really stepped up and was able to help the community in a lot of different ways as far as getting residents in and out of certain areas. And you've been with the metro, I think for a couple years, right? You told us so you were probably there when that was happening.


# COMMUNITY SERVICE VIA SANTA CRUZ METRO


Danielle Glagola  5:14  
Yeah, so I'm coming up on two years in July. And we did do a lot for the fires. So when that happened, we kind of donated the use of our Scotts Valley Transit Center to Cal Fire and they use that as a base during the wildfire, and then we also sent our our fixed route buses up there to help with evacuations. And then for some of the mountain towns that was harder to get a bus through, we sent our pair crews vans up there, and just, you know, loaded people and their, you know, belongings into each of the vans and brought them back, we would take people to the temporary shelters, to the bus station, you know, wherever they needed to go. It was a huge joint effort. I mean, we had operators just working around the clock. When the fires broke out, you know, we sent teams over there right away, so many people just volunteered operators, supervisors, management team, you know, to help in any way that they could.


Interviewer  5:14  
That is so cool. And it sounds like the people who work for the metro, really, maybe part of the reason why they take the job is because of their love for the community and like wanting to be of service to the community in any way they can by working with the metro.


Danielle Glagola  6:26  
Yeah, I fully agree. I mean, that's, you know, talking to people and staff around here. That's the primary reason that people take a job here. I mean, our operators just love the community. They like talking to people, they're really great ambassadors for the Metro brands, you know, sometimes it's the first person that rider will see in the morning, or the last person. And so you know, they're always being, you know, courteous and doing their greetings, but they also helped with our outreach events, you know, so in December, we had a lot of our operators come out and help with our first annual stuff the bus event that we did at the Target in Watsonville. And in partnership with toys for tots, and we raised a bunch of toy donations, we literally filled the entire bus full of donations, and were able to give that to the community. And so our staffs doing stuff like that all the time.


Interviewer  7:15  
That is so cool. So, forgive me if I'm mistaken, but were there like, donation, like boxes, like on the buses that people could donate to?


Danielle Glagola  7:26  
Yeah, so we actually set we parked the bus there. And then we also had a tent, you know, kind of like a pop up tent in front of target. So people could donate at the bus or with us at the tents. And you know, CalFire and Watsonville Fire Department were there assembling bikes, so people would literally come out of the store with cart loads of toy donations. So awesome. And we completely filled the bus. It was amazing.


Interviewer  7:54  
And figuratively with love too right


Danielle Glagola  7:57  
Oh, yeah. So much. It was so great. And the fire departments were key. In assembling those bikes. We actually had so many bike donations. We couldn't fit them all on the bus. So they took them over in their trucks,


Interviewer  8:12  
To use like the bus's bike racks?


Danielle Glagola  8:15  
Yeah, we did. We felt the bike racks. And then we fit as many as we could inside. And then you still didn't have enough room. So we had to make a couple of trips.


# ASPECTS OF WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT


Interviewer  8:23  
Really cool. I think though, like one thing, the Metro is that maybe wasn't part of the other two jobs is your job. Now it's a government job. That's correct. Right. Yes, that


Danielle Glagola  8:32  
Yes, that is correct.


Interviewer  8:35  
Was that kind of like a bigger process like joining, you know, a government organization like the metro?


Danielle Glagola  8:42  
Yeah, the the startup process wasn't, wasn't so intense. But the, you know, getting used to being in a public ran agency was definitely an adjustment coming from private. We work with, you know, a lot of our board members are city council members or mayors. So it's been a great experience getting to work with them on that, you can see that, you know, it's great that they're on our board, because they actually enable us to really give back and support the community in different ways.


Interviewer  9:10  
Yeah. And like, maybe they have just like some, maybe just a different level of insight and kind of like what certain needs are, maybe for the community.


Danielle Glagola  9:19  
Yeah, they definitely do. I mean, they all have, you know, their communities that they represent. So they speak to those people all the time. So they really are understanding, you know, what they need from Metro and as far as public transportation goes, what routes need to be more developed, possibly areas that are kind of underserved, that we should investigate more, if you know, if a certain bus stop is needed, that's not there now, they report back to us. And so that's really great knowledge for us to have is really having people involved in the community that can give us feedback.


Interviewer  9:51  
Yeah, I can imagine. And also maybe working for the government, you have a different kind of retirement package. or incentives that are probably really great, like CalPERS Benefits?


Danielle Glagola  10:04  
Yeah we do. So yeah, Metro does offer CalPERS, which is great. So people can be invested in that program. We also offer really great competitive salaries and benefits packages, and we have life insurance, you know, everything, pension programs. So, you know, when people are looking for jobs at Metro, that's, you know, something that's brought up a lot. I mean, it's a key incentivizer for us is that we are offering, you know, careers that have lifelong benefits to it.


# METRO JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW PROJECTS


Interviewer  10:36  
And I think my friend was telling me that like the metros like looking for, for drivers and mechanics right now.


Danielle Glagola  10:43  
We are so yes, so we're right now accepting for a lot of positions. And two of them are the operators and mechanics. Our operator recruitment goes till I believe, March 13. And actually, right now, we're offering a $4,000 sign on bonus for new operators, and that's paid in three installments. So the key about, you know, being wanting to be a driver or bus operator is we do all the training in house, you know, we'll we'll set you up with a classroom training. Once you get through that portion, you know, we'll help you get your driver's license, then when you you know, you get to a certain point, we'll get you on the bus driving with trainers and do the whole program for you. So the thing that we always say in our recruitments is we can teach you to drive but we can't teach you customer service. So as long as you love people, and you want to work with the community, then you're probably a great candidate for the job.


Interviewer  11:38  
Okay, and we were talking a little bit before the interview, and you were telling me about how the Metro has purchased some electric buses. Would you be kind enough to tell us about those?


Danielle Glagola  11:47  
Yeah, so last fall, we received our first four all electric zero emission buses. They're a model called Proterra. And so we're using that throughout the county right now, specifically dedicated to our Watsonville circulator route, which is a free service in Watsonville, that goes from the Watsonville transit center in a counterclockwise and clockwise loop. And that passes through, you know, Freedom Boulevard, Freedom Center, and it's a free service. So everybody can use that it's free for a year, we received an amazing grant to offset operator costs for that. And because we receive that we're offering that to the community. So it's great and then the other two are in service county wide. So you might just see them on random routes. And then we're in the process right now of obtaining four more for highway 17, actually.


Interviewer  12:42  
Yeah, the 17 route definitely seems like it'd be great to get an electric bus running that, you know, because of the distance and you know, that type of thing.


Danielle Glagola  12:49  
Yeah it will. Being a commuter route, we think it would be really environmentally friendly to have a zero emission bus traveling that distance. We were a little bit hesitant at first to see you know, how it was going to perform on the mountains. So last year, our fleet team did a bunch of testing with the Proterras that we have, and they outperformed completely what we thought they were going to do. So we decided to go ahead and move forward with that. So they're in process right now.


Interviewer  13:19  
Okay and yeah, I'm thinking about making the switch to electric, your mechanics maybe had to undergo some training, right to be able to like work on those.


Danielle Glagola  13:30  
Yeah, they did. So Proterra, came out here and trained our staff on how to use them. And then they go through training on their own as well, too. So it was a long process. And then we also have to teach the operators how to drive them to so it's a long process between, you know, testing, and then all of the training that goes behind obtaining a new type of vehicle.


Interviewer  13:51  
Okay, yeah. And I think I've seen a couple of them around town, and they look pretty sweet. Do the 17 routes offer Wi Fi for the passengers?


Danielle Glagola  14:01  
Yes. 17 commuter service does offer free Wi Fi. Yeah, and we're in the process right now of looking into expanding that service countywide on all of our fixed route buses.


Interviewer  14:13  
That seems that seems really awesome. And I can imagine, like, what the way things are nowadays, you know, people want to stay connected, especially like if they're going to be like on a longer route and things like that they can like get schoolwork done or checking emails and not really have to worry about using data. Right?


Danielle Glagola  14:27  
Totally. I think it'll be really helpful for everybody. I mean, some people have data limit, some people are out of service networks, you know, and so having Wi Fi on a bus is key, you know, we want to make sure that everybody has connectivity.


# EXPANDING EXISTING METRO SERVICES 


Interviewer  14:41  
Okay. And I know the Metro is great in providing service like the ParaCruz. Do you want to tell us about that?


Danielle Glagola  14:47  
Yeah so we do provide our ParaCruz. service and qualifying individuals can go ahead and enroll in that program apply. It's our paratransit service for the for the county as well and so there's smaller vans that are operated and go ahead and get picked up. It's basically like a door to door service. So you can let us know the address you want to get picked up at and the address you want to get dropped off at. And in, as long as you're in our service area, which is three quarters of a mile from one of our bus stops, you know, that means you're in the service area. And so we take a lot of patients to, you know, doctor's appointments to the grocery store to just run regular errands and things like that. And that's great. So if anybody's interested in the eligibility for that, or the process, they can go on our website for that, too. And then another interesting part of that is on those same vans of ParaCruz., we're operating a cruise on demand program. So it's a shared ride experience similar to you know, like Uber or something where you have an app and you put in, you know, where you want to get picked up and where you want to get dropped off. And it can be the same day, you don't have to book it in advance, and you'll get picked up by one of our vans and then dropped off to any location within a three mile distance of your pickup address.


Interviewer  16:05  
Wow, that sounds super awesome. And yeah, so convenient,


Danielle Glagola  16:08  
Really convenient. And for that service, you don't have to qualify or apply. It's available to any community members.


Interviewer  16:15  
Okay. And like the costs associated with using that service. Is that something that like maybe some people's insurance would cover? Or is that just something that they're gonna have to pay for out of pocket?


Danielle Glagola  16:24  
You know, I couldn't speak to the insurance part of it. I'm not sure there might be some funding there, I'd have to ask her ParaCruz team a little bit more. For like a standard ParaCruz ride it's about $6. It depends on a few factors. But that's usually the way Cruise on demand vary slightly. But you know, usually you can get picked up for four to $6 Depending on the length of the trip,


Interviewer  16:48  
Which seems really cheap. And I know from experience, like that's way cheaper than any kind of Uber service


Danielle Glagola  16:53  
Completely. Yeah, it's much cheaper. And actually the better comparison is like Uber pool. So you're actually, you know, carpooling with people, which is great, too. We're not just having one passengers cars out there. Yeah, you're picking people up along your way to your destination. And so you know, less cars on the road that way, too.


# GENERAL JOB RESPONSIBILITIES


Interviewer  17:13  
Yes. Great point, Danielle. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the what TV show on KSQD Santa Cruz 90.7 FM. I'm speaking with Danielle Glagola, who's the marketing communications and customer service director for the Santa Cruz Metro. And yeah, so Danielle, it looks like you wear a lot of different hats with the metro. Which I would imagine keeps you very busy. Do you want to kind of talk about some of your just main duties and responsibilities?


Danielle Glagola  17:39  
Yeah, so you know, marketing, communication and customer services my title. So there's a lot in there, and the customer service side. So we have a great team of customer service representatives that work out of metro center off of Pacific Avenue in downtown Santa Cruz, and then also the Watsonville transit center. And so we have two customer service Windows, one at each of those transit centers so that, you know, we can answer questions, sell passes, and tickets, you know, give route details. And we manage that team, we also do bulk orders and orders for the city and county and web sales as well through that. And then involved in that as a lot of customer service messaging. So you know how to get the word out about new products and services. And we do that through a variety of ways. We have, we've published a quarterly publication called Headways, which comes out has all of our routes and schedules on it. And then any kind of frequently asked questions or what's going on with Metro currently, that's printed and kind of sent out county wide, so you can get those on a lot of different locations. And then it's also posted on the website there too. And then as far as the communications aspect goes, so kind of any press releases that our companies sending out would be, you know, coming from me, which is then you know, posted on social media and our website. Any press interviews, any commercials, TV, radio, all of that stuff falls under my departments. And then for the marketing aspect of it, it's all of our bus advertisements, any kind of logos that's out there on our new Proterras that we were talking about the electric buses, we have a new vinyl wrap on those. So transitioning from paint to vinyl, which is more environmentally friendly. And so that came from this department as well. And we're actually getting some new Gillings in a few months, which is a type of fixed route bus, which will have vinyl wrapping on it instead, too. And then you know, website design. So there's a lot, you know, that kind of falls under the three departments there.


# PRIORITIZING SAFETY THROUGH COVID


Interviewer  19:45  
I bet, and maybe the publication that you're talking about, you said it comes out quarterly. I would imagine over the last couple of years that the Metro has had to implement some different protocols surrounding safety and some like maybe that publication was used for fun in fact, I mean, the public on what those protocols may be?


Danielle Glagola  20:03  
Yes for sure. Definitely. In COVID, a lot of our headways issues were dedicated to health and prevention measures surrounding the pandemic and everything that metro was doing. And so we put hand sanitizers dispensers and all of our buses and transit centers, we were fogging our vehicles nightly, we offer free complimentary masks on board our vehicles, on our transit centers, you know, we put handwash stations. And so there was a lot that went through that and in addition to all the PPE that, you know, our employees and operators wear, you know, I think that's actually a good reminder now that, you know, even though the California mask mandate has been lifted, that Metro does fall under the TSA mask mandate, which is actually in effect until March 16. And so all riders, all operators need to wear face masks until that time, yeah.


Interviewer  20:58  
All right, right before St. Patty's Day, very cool and then they can go wild. And the bus has never stopped providing service, like kind of when everything first started happening, like locked down some things?


Danielle Glagola  21:13  
Correct. Yeah, we continued to provide service, there was a period in time when COVID first happened that we were essential-only travel, and that's when the Shelter in Place Order was in effect, and so you know, you had to have a purpose and a reason for going out and couldn't really just be at your leisure. And at that time, for operator safety, we went on rotating a and b shifts for them. So some, you know, one week and operator would be at home but receive full pay, and then the following week, they would work. And so we would rotate that schedule, just to ensure their safety a little bit more, and that public contact was kind of minimized at that point.


Interviewer  21:49  
Yeah, I can, I can only imagine like, it must have been a little bit for the drivers themselves to like being exposed to a lot of different people. That must have been tough. And just for the passengers. And I think like at one point, the buses were limiting the number of people that were allowed on?


Danielle Glagola  22:09  
Right, yeah. So with the social distancing guidelines set in place, we did have to limit our capacity for quite some time, actually. And so at one point, it was 18 passengers per 40 foot bus. So I usually I think, with standing room, there's about 60 passengers, you know, on a normal bus. And so that was it was quite drastic. But you know, to help, you know, with that, for a while, we went free fares, so that everybody would board to the back of the bus, they wouldn't have to enter to the front and be close to the operator make payments. So they we would only have rear door boarding and deboarding at that point. And then we also installed operator shields, so it was like a plastic Plexiglas that went up around the operator area. And then we also installed sneeze guards between each row of seating to protect our passengers from each other as well. And then, of course increased, like all of our ventilation efforts and the type of filters we use and all of our vehicles.


Interviewer  23:09  
Sounds like the metro was on top of it as far as doing their best to provide public safety.


Danielle Glagola  23:14  
Yeah, it's our always our number one priority. Very cool.


# WORKING ENVIRONMENTS


Interviewer  23:17  
Danielle, do you want to talk about some of the environments that you work in? Are you mostly working from like your office? Or do you travel around between some of the different metro stations? what's that look like?


Danielle Glagola  23:28  
Yeah, so I'd say probably about 60% of my time is spent at our administrative offices in Santa Cruz, and then the other 40%, I'm traveling from our different facilities and transit centers. So part of Metro we have an operations building that we go to or the fleet building, and then I'll go visit the customer service team at Metro Center and Watsonville transit center. And then you know, I'll have to go check on Scotts Valley and Capitola mall just for a marketing and any materials that we have out there.


Interviewer  24:00  
Very cool in is your administration office. Have I seen that kind of on River Street? Like sort of on your way to Costco?


Danielle Glagola  24:08  
Yes, so we have three buildings right there off of river kind of going up towards highway nine. So on the right hand side is our big operations building and our operations yard that houses our buses. And then on the other side of the road, we have our, you know, fleet building, which the mechanics work out of, and then across the street from that our admin building.


# RECRUITMENT FOR THE METRO AND CAREER ADVICE


Interviewer  24:30  
Very cool. And you know, Danielle, what kind of person do you think would enjoy the type of work you do with the metro?


Danielle Glagola  24:37  
Yeah, kind of what I was touching on earlier people you know, somebody who really likes to be involved in the community is key for any position at Metro and then in specifically like marketing or communications, somebody who has a design background or kind of a PR background. I think even people who work in nonprofits would love this or or, you know, people who enjoy hosting events would be great. And even people interested in social media. I mean, we're always needing help on that aspect too. You know, we're always open to accepting interns for programs too. So that would be great. And then, you know, there's like mechanics we were saying, you know, anybody who has that kind of experience or a trait that they want to put into use, we can use.


Interviewer  25:22  
Well, thank you for that, Danielle. And, you know, what kind of advice can you give to someone who is unsure about their career path? 


Danielle Glagola  25:28  
I would say you know, find something that you love to do. That's always my key to everybody. You know, you'll love life more. And you'll be happy at work if you actually enjoy what you do. So, you know, for me, personally, I really enjoy working at Metro I love everybody that I work with, I like the community, it's fun to see projects from start to finish. And so if you have you know, something that you're inspired by might single one, go and get it and do what it takes to achieve that goal.
