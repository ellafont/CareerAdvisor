# INTRODUCTION


Interviewer  0:18  
Hello and welcome everyone to KSGD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and you're listening to our show Want To Be, where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What to be is a program provided by Your Future Is Our Business at Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, panels and other work based learning activities. Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of natural bridges, media, or your futures are business. The information provided during this program does not reflect its career in its entirety. And today, I have the pleasure of welcoming to the show, Senator John Laird. Hi, John.


John Laird  1:00  
Hey, Patrick. Pleasure to be here.


Interviewer  1:02  
Thank you very much for joining us and coming into the station. I really appreciate you taking the time. It's been really nice talking to you before the interview. John, would you please describe your career journey? I know you have a long, awesome career of public service. Do you mind telling us about it?


John Laird  1:17  
Well, we were talking beforehand, I came to UCSC. And I was in the fourth full class. So 68 to 72. And I graduated with honors in politics. And I used to joke that, for the longest time, I was the only UCSC politics grad to actually get a job in politics. And I think one thing that might reflect a little on this is when I was at UC Santa Cruz, if you were in politics aboard you had a choice. You can either have comprehensive examinations where your professors barked theory questions at you for a few hours. Or you could write your undergraduate thesis. And that was not a choice for me. So I wrote an undergraduate thesis. And I wrote it on the history of water development in California. And I ended up being obsessed for six months and ended up getting honors in the thesis. I think it's why I got Honors at graduation, and now I have never been far from water policy my entire career. And so they're just certain things you do along the way. And yes, I've been a mayor and a Cabrillo trustee and Assembly Member and a cabinet secretary, although a cabinet secretary overwater, and now I'm back in the Senate. And so they're just certain things. And I've been doing it long enough for certain things that have really impacted me.


Interviewer  2:39  
I'm sure. And so it sounds like you had an idea, you know, in school that you wanted to be in public service.


# EARLY LIFE


John Laird  2:45  
I did. My parents were teachers. And I really liked sort of being involved in community things. And I'm not sure I knew exactly what path that would take. And there's so many times that I've just kept very close to going on another path related to it. And then something in life, yanked me back. It's, for example, I was, I think, two years out of UCSC. And I went and I ran a field operation for a congressman running for the Senate in Florida. I usually have no reason to talk about this. This was forever ago. And I'd only been to Florida once to the Democratic National Convention. And it was an interesting experience. I was all over the state. I met a lot of people and they kept saying, oh, we went, you should come to Washington with us. And I know my future is in California, whatever I'm going to do. I'm going back home. And then on election day, I finally said, I'd consider coming and being on the Washington staff. And then he lost by 7000 votes in the primary statewide in Florida. And I kept meeting these people when I was Resources Secretary that the guy that was Deputy Secretary of the Interior actually had been a Senate staffer for 20 years or so, before he moved over into the administration. I thought, geez, I could have been doing that. That could have been that way. But it just veered another way. And I came back from California to California. I've been in California for two days and I was wondering what am I going to do? And then Santa Cruz County called and said, you submitted an application and we have another vacancy, would you like to come in the next thing. I knew I was being trained to do the county's Health and Social Services budget in Santa Cruz County and I became a budget analyst and did everything I was ever involved with. I was the budget chair in the assembly and so you just have certain paths that you don't realize are going to take you somewhere.


Interviewer  4:46  
And you know, from what you studied in school did probably there was probably a lot of learning I guess when you went out to be you know, to be on some on staff. And was there a lot of structure there or did you have to kind of figure out, you know, things on your own?


John Laird  5:04  
You had to figure out a lot on your own. And I even had to do that. When I started with the county, there were certain skills I didn't have. And I don't think it could happen this way. Now you have to have a graduate degree, you have to have a Master's of Public Administration. And they explained to me once later, that they sort of looked for people that they thought, might really have the ability to do it, but might need a little more training, rather than somebody that could just come and do it, but my plod along and that I fit that category. And so I was flattered that they said that, but it meant that they really took a chance on me. And it's been a really good thing for me, because I hire staff now to sort of look for who I think are really smart people, even if they might still need training, and in what it is, because the smartness is what will carry them. And it's funny, because when I had a chance and this is so ironic, because it was when Jerry Brown was governor the first time and he hired me the second time, there was a vacancy on the board of supervisors in Santa Cruz, and I was considered by the governor's office for an appointment. And I was 26. And the county administrator said, you have to make a choice. You either are going the political route, or the administrative route, you could probably be a County Administrator at some point. Or if you do the political route, you're giving that up. And you really need to go into politics. And so I after four or five years, elected the city council and with the political route, but he was still alive. When Jerry Brown appointed me Secretary of Natural Resources to be the administrator over 19,000 people and manage a $10 billion budget and, and I called him up and said, You were wrong. You don't have to make that choice. And he loved it. He thought that was hilarious. And I'm glad you've lived long enough to see that. But those are the interesting things about choices you make in your life.


Interviewer  7:09  
That must have been a lot of pressure, though, to have that responsibility of a budget that big.


John Laird  7:16  
I hate to even describe it because those eight years I ended up being the only Cabinet Secretary that went first day last day with Jerry Brown. And I thought this was so intense. I'm not sure I'll be able to do this the whole time. And then it was so demanding to get excited. And let me tell you, I was in charge of water for four of the driest years of California history. I had the misfortune of being in charge of water when the dam overflowed Oroville at the misfortune of being in charge of CalFire when we had some of the worst fires, and in the last months I was there Paradise, and wood. But we also have the largest marine set of marine protected areas off the coast of any state. Our climate work was ahead of the other 49 states, we were able to do so much more affirmatively while we were dealing with these natural disasters, many of which were related to the changing climate. And so in the first weekend, when I was done, I was starting to run immediately. But it was still two years out. First weekend, geez, I made all these phone calls, did our taxes. We took a walk, we went out to dinner. And I said to my spouse that I used to be really busy. And I thought he was gonna kill me because it just stopped and it used to be just all consuming all the time.


Interviewer  8:40  
Yeah. And I guess when it felt like that, you know, what you probably developed some like self care practices that helped, you know, keep you center.


John Laird  8:49  
Well, I always tried to protect certain weekend days, which wasn't easy. And I was traveling all over the state. But if I could protect Sunday, I considered a big victory to just not schedule. And we tried to take some time off. But it was so demanding that usually it was two weeks or two and a half weeks in December. So we would block it out. We would go away. I would just be off the grid. But it isn't. It isn't easy. The best I could do is try to just not be tired and make sure I ate well.


Interviewer  9:29  
Are there certain times of the year I guess it depends on what's going on when you can block off you know enough time to get away on vacation?


John Laird  9:36  
Well in that job, the only time was Christmas in two weeks or two and a half weeks around that and New Years. That was the only time that anything ever for sure slowed down because you're always in a budget cycle or a legislative cycle or a fire cycle or a flood cycle or something was going on that was in a major way.


# CAREER PATHWAY


Interviewer  9:58  
Yeah, and you know, throughout your career, did you have someone or maybe even when you're starting out like a mentor, someone you could bounce stuff off of, you know, when you weren't sure what maybe which direction to go and your career, or maybe when you moved along?


John Laird  10:11  
I always had a few. And it was or had a few. And it was interesting, because one of them I mentioned already, the guy that was the County Administrator, his name was Ted Durkee. He was here in Santa Cruz in the 1970s, his County Administrator, and he was just a meritorious person, he did things on the issues by the books, he had integrity in our office, he would excuse me, he would sort of give us direction and let us do it. And our big fear was, we would let him down. And he would do cover on the political side, while we were trying to do the facts are do the right thing. And the interesting thing is, when I talk about taking chances, you look at who was in that office in the 1970s, the criminal justice guy went on to be the chief administrator for the California Supreme Court. And one of the analysts and planning went on to head the planning for urban boundaries and things for King County, Washington. And one went on to be a county administrative officer, one went on to be the planning director, one went on to be the parks director, the one who stayed and was the budget officer for almost 30 years was a genius on budgeting in that and somebody went on to be the health director in Oregon. And so it turns out this young group was sort of hungry and was holding on to it, and I did whatever you could characterize my career as coming out of that. And the guy that was an intern, and then a young analyst became the 10th employee, at Clif Bar, and I think their attorney over the time, and it's done really well. And so it just, they were just risk taken, for hiring everyone. And we were young and good, and then went on to things and it's, you sort of can make a choice in an office to hire people like that. And it happened to me when I was resources secretary, my general counsel went to the Public Utilities Commission. Now she's head of the Air Board, and my Deputy Secretary for federal water is now head of the State Water Board. And the person that I, we hired to help with oil and gas is now the undersecretary of resources. And there are people all throughout the state government that are used to work with, it's very exciting. And if it's better to hire people that other people might want at some point, because that means they're good, and they're going to do a good job for you.


Interviewer  12:54  
Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, you've had such a long career, do you want to talk about maybe some of your more favorite projects that you've worked on? You shared with me before the show about your energy bill that you helped in the past? And that was very special? Do you mind telling us about that? That's a great story.


John Laird  13:10  
So I'm trying to think of which energy bill the one that the governor just signed? Maybe, yes, because that actually, there's a couple but the major one I would just talk about is what you seated, and that is last year at this time. We were at the end of the legislative session, and the one climate bill that was tough, died on the Senate floor seven votes short, on the last day of session, we did not pass. We did good budget stuff. But we did not pass a tough climate bill. And so the senate president said I'm not going to let that happen again. And she appointed a 12 Senator Working Group on climate, across geographical boundaries, ideological boundaries, diversity, and she named me the chair. And we had 25 meetings and nine or more stakeholders, we met with environmental justice environmental groups, with oil companies, with the building trades unions, with non building trades unions with local governments, you know, with business and then we hashed it out and we came up with a bill package. And just as we are doing the show, Friday morning, the governor signed 11 bills we put on his desk from this climate working group to deal with well capping and equity in electric vehicles. But the biggest Bill was a bill that would have California be carbon neutral in its operations in 10 years, roughly 10 years and would also set interim goals for the 2045 100% carbon neutral goal for the state. And that became my bill. I had the Senate president and all the members of the working group as co authors, and that's what the governor signed on on Friday morning. And, and I think the governor came in with a few weeks to go and said, I want these four bills. And I'm gonna incorporate a fifth one in my package. And the fifth one was my bill. And we weren't sure. I mean, one of these bills was to actually put into statute to a 2045 goal which is done by executive order. And one was that you had to have 3200 foot setback from an oil well, which has been very controversial. And there was capping oil wells, there was carbon capture. And in the end, we got every one of those bills off the Senate floor, and they had been defeated on the Senate floor before and they had elements of that bill that was defeated at the end of session last year, the assembly defeated one and it didn't come to him, but that is what he was signing the other morning. And so it was really it was I'm gonna go to the COP climate conference in Egypt in November, and I think California will have a roll thereafter, all the stuff that we've done this year.


Interviewer  16:12  
Well, that's wonderful. And congratulations on that bill. That sounds fascinating. Was it signed in Palais Holden's, that was?


John Laird  16:18  
So that's another story. That's my hometown. That's where I lived till I was 17. And so I stood up and said, just before I made my comments on the climate bill, with the governor right there that this was a message to anybody that went to cave elementary school, or Springsteen, junior high school, or Hogan high school that you two could go into the legislature author a big bill and have the governor come to your hometown to sign it and everybody cheered. And then he was asked in the question period, why he chose to sign the climate villas in Vallejo. And he said, Senator Laird would want nothing else. And I thought, oh, man, I'm just golden and Phileo. All my friends and Phileo social media have been exploding since that happened. And you know, you asked you teed up that one, but there's one other one. And it's really timely, and I might have talked about it with Rachel and Goodman, but the Watsonville hospital bill this year. And it's just an unbelievable circumstance. I mean, I played a monumental role, but it was the community that really stepped up in an unbelievable way. But, you know, near the end of last year, the hedge fund that ran Watsonville hospital announced they were bankrupt, they were going to close it. I remember hearing that, yeah, lay everybody off. And so in January, I did a bill at 19 days to create a hospital district. And normally bills took seven months, 90 days, we got it through both houses and to the governor's desk and he signed it. And when the public hospital district was five days old, the bankruptcy court accepted their bid for the hospital. And then the community and all of us had seven months to raise $65 million, which would cover the purchase cost and also the operating deficit for the bulk of the first year. And that was raised and the purchase was finalized on the last day of August. They even sent me the Certificate of sale and Robert Rivas and I got 25 million in the state budget this year. So we made sure the state did 25 million, and then 40 million was really matched by the agencies or individuals in this area. That hospital employs over 600 people, it's the basic care for a disadvantaged community. And they would have had to go for health care to Dominican and Santa Cruz or Netivot, ADRA. Salinas Valley Memorial and Salinas. I mean, there could have been loss of life that happened. And so that is just a monumental victory. Now, of course, we have to make work, but I think it's on the path. And that is, it is just exciting. Because I think I'm just at that point in my career where I feel skilled, if I know what I have to do, I'm really gonna do it. There was one key time where there was a legislator in the other house, and I had to say, can't say, every word that I said on the air, but get the blank out of the way, just get the blank out of the way we're gonna do this. And that person got out of the way and the bill moved, and here we are. So, I mean, I think that right, it's great because the Watsonville hospital closed on the day that all the climate bills got out of the legislature at the end of session. It was like everything. I had this other bill that made sure that kids of Sergeant Damon got Swidler and Elizabeth Butler of the Santa Cruz Police Department got their full survivor's benefits because I As the officers and the parents were killed in the line of duty, but they weren't married to their spouses. And so the kids that survived did not get the full survivor's benefits that a kid would get in that instance. And so I did a bill that recognized the different family pattern. A lot went retroactive, got them covered. And the governor signed it on the same day that Watsonville hospital closed and the climate bills got out. And so on your roll? Yeah. I mean, I told you beforehand, I feel like I'm running on fumes right now. And yet, because good things have.


# COMMUNITY LIFE


Interviewer  20:36  
A lot of good things happening. Thank you so much for all the things that you just mentioned in that hospital that's so important to keep that open in South County.


John Laird  20:44  
And I'm really proud of that. But I'm really proud of the community. I'm proud of everybody that stepped up. People knew they knew that we had to do this. And there were so many times along the way where we thought this is just almost impossible. How are we going to do this? Because there were times when the amount of money raised was stuck. And it was about 20 million short. And, you know, there's been a contribution of the record system. And there's just lots of people, I mean, Driscoll strawberries, there's one $5 million donor, I still don't know, there were 500 individuals. I spoke to the Watsonville Rotary Club and a well known person that I know followed me out, he ended up donating $50,000, after that speech, and I, the Board of Supervisors here did something the Board of Supervisors in Monterrey, the Central Coast Health Alliance, Kaiser hospital, whose doctors privilege or clinic whose Doctor school would just depend on Watsonville hospital stay open, they stepped up in a number of ways. But there were just people. It was just amazing. And you know, it restores, or at least accentuates your faith in a community and what a great place to live because everybody knew that this was important. And people figured out a way to make it.


Interviewer  22:03  
Yeah. And maybe you had a feeling about this, how great this community is when you came here for school, and it sounds like you didn't leave?


John Laird  22:09  
I left for two years.


Interviewer  22:10  
Did you?


John Laird  22:11  
Yes. And then came screaming back.


Interviewer  22:13  
To Florida, maybe?


John Laird  22:14  
Well, Florida, but also I went to work for a member of Congress, who ironically, was running against Jerry Brown for governor the first time when I graduated from UCSC. And when I was interviewed by Jerry Brown to be in his cabinet, and he's looking at my resume, I was thinking, Oh, how's this gonna go? And he says, that was the last person to run for governor that had integrity, that didn't pull everybody to find out what they thought. I imagined what he thought. And I thought that was fascinating that he said that I was glad because it was good for me moving ahead. But it was an interesting statement about Jerry Brown and my interview with him. I haven't pulled it out lately, but it was so fascinating. It was supposed to go half an hour, and it went two hours. And over the next week, I tried to write down as much as I could remember. And one of my favorite stories is that he says, when I was mayor of Oakland, people wanted to make sure I appointed this very large percentage of African American commissioners and things. And now, people are asking that I appoint a significant percentage of Latino Californians, you don't appear to present much diversity. And he looks across the table. He says that. So I hold up my hand and I show him my wedding ring. And I said, I'm one half of one of the 18,000 couples who got married in 2008, whose marriage stood because you stood up with Kamala Harris and made sure the Court affirmed that and he said, Oh, we are so over represented with gay people. And I thought I would never live long enough to hear somebody say that too. Because that was another thing that I don't think, you know, when I was elected mayor in Santa Cruz, which will be 39 years ago this November, I was one of the first three openly gay mayors in the history of the United States. And when I was, you know, thinking, in high school or college, I mean, I'm not sure that I knew how much that was going to be a part of the universe. When I graduated from UCSC, it was still against the law to be gay in all 50 states. And yet, there's another thing I look back on with gay pride, great pride, because, you know, I did what I thought was right, I wasn't sure. I was gonna be on the right side of history. And it turns out that I probably am.


Interviewer  24:38  
And it seems like that's from what you've shared, a pretty consistent theme.


John Laird  24:43  
Well, it's a message to I think anybody that's, that's going into politics for what I think the right reasons is always figure out a way to be true to yourself and, and there's going to be some new assembly members from the area and I really liked them and support them. And I've been talking to them and I said, you know, those first months, when you're in the legislature, you get tested, you've added some tough things. And it's really good to decide then where the lines are. Cuz then people will expect it, you'll feel comfortable, you might feel like it's a hard vote at the beginning. But it really defines where you should be on something and how you should do it. I think it's interesting, Santa Cruz city is really changing. I mean, there's these races for, for districts, we've never had council districts in modern times, they used to have years and years and years ago in Santa Cruz. And I think it's, it's gonna bring in a new group of people, people that are probably more neighborhood oriented people that have to worry, because a very small number of people will control their election and, you know, one bad public hearing, and you're probably in trouble. And it's gonna be really interesting for them, because it's going to be new energy, and new commitment. But it's gonna be really intense grassroots politics.


Interviewer  26:05  
It must be really nice, you know, just seeing the progression of our community and, you know, the political career that you've that you've served.


John Laird  26:14  
Oh, it really is. And there have been some really changes. And now, of course, there's real challenges. I mean, we still have what to do to help people that are unhoused and deal with that we have an incredible housing issue here. And you know, and yet, climate affects Santa Cruz a bit, the fog is different, sea level rises could have hit, never thought I'd have to be packed and ready to go on the west side. But two summers ago, the fire was getting close to those just our fire department at the city limits. So the impacts of climate are affecting us in this temperate coastal seaside town.


Interviewer  27:01  
Yeah. And thank you for what you've done in your career to, you know, support protecting the climate, and environment.


John Laird  27:07  
I keep saying I got a resounding ovation at an event on the last day of that. And I said, I'm not done yet. We still have a lot to do.’


# ADVICE FOR STUDENTS


Interviewer  27:17  
John, what kind of advice can you give to students who are interested in pursuing a career in politics or public service?


John Laird  27:25  
I think it's really good to just get your handset and somehow volunteer, in turn being a campaign. Because I think it starts to give you experience, but it also starts to tell you what you like. And I think this is true for anybody broader than politics. Hopefully, you find something that just motivates you every day. It's really interesting. I mean, one of the joys for me about my particular job is it's always different. You know, the, the, my Undersecretary noise secretary was so afraid I'd be in Santa Cruz because I'm here during the weekend. I'd be in Santa Cruz whenever a major disaster comes and I could never get out of here. And then lo and behold, it's it's a winter I think, 2017 It's the first weekend it hasn't rained in a month, I go out and we're actually in the yard because we haven't been able to be in the yard and I come in about five o'clock and my water deputy calls and says there's this thing going on at Oroville Dam. And then the Cal Fire Chief calls and says they just evacuated 180,000 People know the governor's office called and said Get the hell up here. At 11 o'clock that night, I was briefing 120 legislators or staff members about what was going on at Oroville Dam. And so that's the other thing. It's different, but you're never quite sure what's gonna happen. I didn't know how every day was going to end for about two weeks when that was going on. And so yeah.


Interviewer  29:00  
That's got to just be interesting. And I just want to thank you again for all the great and meaningful work that you've done in supporting our community in the state.


John Laird  29:08  
My pleasure.


Interviewer  29:09  
And thank you again for taking the time to come in. You know, it's great.


John Laird  29:12  
Thank you for putting up with me. I look forward to seeing you again.
