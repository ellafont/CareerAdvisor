Yeah, so I work at Haven of Hope. We're a short term residential therapeutic program. And we serve Foster and probation youth ages 18. Or sorry, 1218. Um, we also have those of that's the age group that I work with. We also have homes for 18 to 21 year olds. Um, but I started with Haven of Hope. We have an internship and field study program with UCSC. And so I started there about 10 as a you undergraduate UCSC, intern, about 10 years ago, I was getting my bachelor's in psychology at UCSC. And so I did about a six month field study placement, with Haven of Hope. And then after I graduated, I really liked the environment I really liked, I built some relationships with the the staff and the kids. And so I decided I wanted to stay on. And so from there, I transitioned to a direct care staff for several years. And then I was in charge of the our staff training. So as their training coordinator, and then I've been in my current role as program manager since 2018. Okay, well, congratulations

Interviewer  2:33  
in and thank you for, you know, for the work that your organization does, I think, you know, it's very meaningful, of course, and an asset to our community. So, yeah, did you know, you know, when you were going to school that you that this was like the line of work that you were interested in pursuing?

Emma Spiller  2:54  
no, I really, I really didn't, I just kind of was, yeah, I really wasn't like, didn't have a clear path and wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. And I went through different things that I thought I would be interested in that I really wasn't. After I took some some classes. In college, I brought about different things I didn't actually, they weren't actually as interesting to me as I thought they would be. And what I really found that I liked was working with people. And so that is kind of how I got to psychology. And what I really like about working here to help, I'm working directly with lots of different people. And so yeah, that's not the I don't know that I had a real I didn't really have a plan. But it No, definitely not something that I was planning on, but definitely a field that I will be staying in. Moving forward.

Interviewer  3:52  
That's yeah, very cool. And how awesome is that? That your your field study your internship turned in to your career? Yeah.

Emma Spiller  4:00  
And I didn't I mean, I think when I graduated and decided to stay with even a job that was 10 ish years ago, and I still, I think, for the first couple years, it was like, Oh, I'm not sure how long they'll be here. I don't know how long it'll be in Santa Cruz and things like that. And it really has been a place that I've gotten to kind of grow up in and learn different skills. And now I can't really see myself in anywhere else.

Interviewer  4:26  
That is awesome. Thanks for sharing. And I'll just share real quick that I'm studying psychology at UCSD and I have my field study coming up this summer. So I'm really excited. Yeah.

Emma Spiller  4:36  
There's a talk to me cool options. Yeah. And

Interviewer  4:39  
it's fun talking to different classmates who and hearing how much they're enjoying their, their field studies at different organizations may be similar or not to what you're doing.

Emma Spiller  4:49  
Yeah, have you as Can I ask you a question? Have you have you picked a place? Where are you going to do? Yeah,

Interviewer  4:55  
so I'm going to do this psychology and cognitive science international field study. So it's going to be in Barcelona for eight weeks, I will be working at a organization called Timbo family club. And they're going to have me develop like a health and wellness program for their kids there that are aged three to seven. So that's in about a month and a half. So yes, very excited.

Emma Spiller  5:16  
Oh, my gosh, that's so exciting.

Interviewer  5:17  
Thank you so much for Yeah, thank you for asking, then do you want to share with us, you know what some of your main duties and responsibilities are? At Haven of Hope?

Emma Spiller  5:26  
Yeah, so I, we have I've, I'm kind of responsible for six kids, there's six kids in at my house, we have two homes. So we have six other kids that aren't under my direct care, that I oversee kind of all of their, all of their care, and so that I do a lot of coordinating with social workers, probation officers, their families, their schools, and any kind of identified supports that they have. And I work with our care team, so all of our direct care staff, and we have a full clinical staff. So I coordinate with kind of all of those people to make sure that we're providing the best care we can. And so all of our goal is always to work, we're the highest level of care. And so our goal is to, we see a lot of like really high risk behaviors in acute behavior. And so our goal is to help the kids develop like different strategies and coping skills to step down to a lower level of care. And so that is kind of always what I'm trying to figure out how to best get them to that lower level care, which is like a foster home. Sometimes it's with family, or sometimes it's to live independently for the kids who are like 17, and 18. So I'm kind of in charge of helping how, how do we get there? Yeah,

Interviewer  6:49  
that's, that's a lot. And we're a lot of the skills that you use in your job. Are those things that you learned, like, on the job? Or was there training involved? Or how did it Yeah,

Emma Spiller  6:59  
yeah, there's, um, so I have a bachelor's in psychology. I've had we, I have to do a lot of kind of continuing education. But I'm trained in things like trauma informed care, crisis communication, and how to deal with assaultive behaviors. And then a lot of the skills for the job I've developed over the years. And so a lot of it is like things that can be trained on, but things that really get refined and developed as you're using them. And as you're put in different situations.

Interviewer  7:36  
Okay. Yeah, that's great. And, and let's see, have you it might be is sometimes is it, this type of job, like stressful for you? And have you developed, you know, different ways to, you know, protect your own mental health? You know, when you're working with people that might be going through a difficult time? Yeah,

Emma Spiller  7:54  
yeah, I think that this job is incredibly stressful can be incredibly stressful, and really draining, especially when people are just starting out in kind of residential care or the mental health field. So having a balance, or being able to leave things, I tried to really keep things separate. So when I, if possible, and when I leave work, I'm not doing things like checking my email or, or talking to people from work. Um, that being said, there's, we're more residential care. So we're open 24 hours a day. So sometimes when there's kids who are having a harder time, and we're dealing with more high risk behaviors at a higher rate, that can be really draining, and really stressful. But part of what has kept me a Haven of Hope for so long is our team. And so we have a really supportive management team. And we're a small agency, so we can, so everyone works together and kind of does what is needed to help whoever needs help out. And so relying on the different people on my team, is really helpful. And sometimes it's just like, hey, I've had a really rough week. 

Emma Spiller  9:09  
Can someone help me out with these couple things? Or like I'm on call, two days a week, and then weekend and a Friday a month. And sometimes that's like, Hey, I don't really have capacity to do this right now. So knowing getting to learn my own capacity for things was really kind of like something that I a place that I had to grow in. And that was really hard when I took over the like, program manager job because there's things to do kind of constantly and always. So knowing when to kind of say, Hey, I'm at my limit, I need some help. Or like, hey, I need a break and just really taking time to do something that's not work related. I have a dog so like playing with my dogs or an eye powerlifters or going to the gym, things where I can kind of like check out from the thing things that are super stressful. But I would say that's like a really challenging thing, when when we get newer, newer younger staff in dealing with we there's a lot of like second hand trauma that comes in a job like this. And so learning how to deal with that is is a huge skill. 

Interviewer  10:18  
Yeah, well, and thank you for sharing that. And I think it's great that you can, you know, communicate freely with the people that you work with, and you can be vulnerable and let them know, like, hey, look, this might be a little much, but that you're able to, you know, ask for help. And it sounds like, there's like a real team kind of dynamic, there.

Emma Spiller  10:35  
Yeah, we really work as a team. And that's definitely not something that I was comfortable doing, I definitely have more of a mentality like I can do, I can do it all I want to do, I want to, like, this is my job, this is what I signed up for. And this is what I got to do. And things are hard. But it's just kind of like I have to write it out. But that his I've kind of gotten better at accepting what my limits are. Because ultimately, like when people are burnt out, or not, or or just like have too much on their plate, it just makes the care of the kids and the support I'm able to give to other people. That's what suffers when I'm so I've definitely learned had to learn that like no one to take a break and to top out. Yeah. But yeah, we have a really good team. And I think that that is really what has made me stay in at Haven of Hope for so long. Residential cares, really, really can be really challenging. And it's not a place that people stay for a super long time. But I really like it. 

Interviewer  11:40  
Was it difficult? Have you new people come in, during you know what Polo is going on the last couple years with like, different lock downs and the pandemic?

Emma Spiller  11:50  
Yeah, the pandemic was really hard.  Yeah, I mean, that was a time that like, we are these kids homes. And so there are six kids that I am responsible for. And we had, we've had COVID, I don't know, we had COVID, probably four or five times over the last few years. And it's not us. It's not the kind of environment where I can say like, oh, there's someone, we have COVID I can't come in. So there was a lot of different kinds of there was yeah, that was that was really hard and a lot to deal with. Because we someone I mean, ultimately, there's six kids there who are children and need to be taken care of. And so we did have a lot of people who's who stepped up and and got that, and a lot of people who for totally understandably, we're like, Hey, I can't I can't do this. I can't work in this environment during this time. But yeah, that was that was a really hard couple

Interviewer  12:52  
And it must have been difficult for the people at your organization to you know, the clients. Because, you know, just feeling so disconnected, maybe even more so with all of that. And we're able to help connect them like through, you know, different like, kind of, like zoom type classes or telehealth stuff when needed or, yeah,

Emma Spiller  13:15  
so like, the positive the the good thing about our agency is that we do all of our clinical care in house and so we still have they still like would see either all the kids have to do therapy where a therapeutic program so they would still have their therapists would come in in person, they would still have a fair amount. They were probably seeing more people than most other kids. Honestly, he just because we have, we would have staff coming in and out. 

Emma Spiller  13:41  
Um, but they were just yeah, like they were super zoomed out. I think everyone in in we are kind of in a bubble, generally. And so I think some of our kids who have different levels of processing abilities, we're really not, it was hard for them to understand, like, when we were we had to follow all of the rules and regulations like down to the letter. And so understanding why we had to do that, that I think was pretty hard. And zoom school virtual school I think anyone with with kids can attest that Zoom school was not a good time. Or we experienced it themselves. But when you have six kids in a house and you're they're all trying to do zoom school all day, it definitely was a lot me, man, he's a problem solving skills.

Interviewer  14:39  
Well, hopefully that like maybe that there was some silver linings, you know, throughout that and maybe you were able to like develop you know, certain things like that, during that time that you know, worked going forward.

Emma Spiller  14:52  
I think I mean, it made us we had to get really creative about like, we What about how Do like make things engaging in the house, because but what can happen a lot of time with kids who are more high risk when they're just like bored in the house with each other all the time, it can just just be really hard and create more behaviors that come up and stuff. So getting really creative with with keeping them entertained and keeping them active and not bored in and grumpy. Was was something that yeah, we've definitely dipped skills that we had to learn and build in that have kept that we've kept up since then. 

Interviewer  15:36  
Okay, and with your job, like, what kind of environments do you work in? Are you in your office a lot of the time, are you kind of out and about, you know, with the, with the kids helping them like hands on?

Emma Spiller  15:46  
Yeah, so So both, um, we have, we try to make our setting as kind of home like as possible. There's different kinds of things that go into making our environment safe, that are a little bit outside of the norm. But I work in like a residential house, or in a residential neighborhood, I have like a private office that I use for meetings, or the kids use for therapy, or for any kind of confidential things that we need a space for. But it's in it's in the house. And so I am yeah, I'm in the house. And I do really like to I try to spend as much time with the kids as possible while still getting my work done. So I try to do as much of my kind of like computer office work while they're in school as possible. And then when they get home I, I always I want to, like hang out with them and like make after school snack and like, just like check in about their day and kind of those normal getting home from school kid things. 

Interviewer  16:49  
Thanks for sharing in, and what kind of skills do you think that you know, you use in your job on a daily basis?

Emma Spiller  16:56  
Yeah, um, that, like, peep all skills occasionally, but like, really people's skills and communication. And problem solving, I've worked a lot a lot to try to be clear and direct in kind when having to have really difficult conversations. I've had a lot of training around that stuff. But it really just is something that you have to practice a skill you have to practice over the years. Our days can also be really unpredictable. So I have like us an outline of what is going to happen for the day. And a schedule and kind of like what I hope is going to happen for the day. But that can change. Any second I'm so problem solving. Just like we're a household with six kids. And so that can alone come up with its different kinds of like, like transportation issues and things like that. So I do a lot of problem solving. And it's also kind of my job to look at, like the bigger the big picture and what can happen in the longer term. And think about like the worst case scenarios that can come up. So I also have to use a lot of kind of training and skills around crisis management, in communication. Okay.

Interviewer  18:15  
And I'd imagine there's a lot of great things about your job, too. And I can, what are some of those?

Emma Spiller  18:22  
Yeah, um, I think like, there's so many really positive things. And the positive things have to for me have to outweigh the things that are really hard and really challenging. So some of the positive things that I really like, are just doing those kinds of normal kid things. All of the kids who are placed it at Haven of Hope have had pretty extensive trauma or really, really hard lives. And they haven't always had time to be kids. 

Emma Spiller  18:55  
And so just doing like, cooking dinner for them, or hanging out and watching a movie. And like sometimes doing those simple like fun things. I'm also often the I'm kind of the authoritative person who says yes or no to requests and so that I can often be the person having the really hard conversations. So doing those, like, just simple fun things I really like. And then the bigger kind of rewarding things are kids calling, calling or getting in contact after several years and talking about the impact that human of Hope had on their lives or that I've personally had on their lives. Like going to like kids, high school graduations, things like things like that are really, really like are what keep me in this field.

Interviewer  19:44  
I bet yeah. I mean, playing such an important positive, you know, role, you know, in these people's lives. I would imagine that something that you'll keep with you for a long time.

Emma Spiller  19:52  
Yeah, yeah, there's definitely things that are just like big monumental things that kids want you to be part of which is always really is just really cool. Okay,

Interviewer  20:02  
is your job? I mean, it's a residential facility. Right? So like you said before, it's like a 24 hour care facility. But does your job nine to five are? How do your What are your hours like in a typical week? Yeah, so

Emma Spiller  20:16  
that so that can vary a lot to you, I work Tuesday through Friday, nine to five are kind of my hours on paper. But that I do have a lot of flexibility in terms of what i in terms of my job, because sometimes I'll need to be there till seven or eight. And sometimes I can come in late, early earlier. So just to kind of depending on what's going on. So when things are a little bit easier, and there's not as much going on. I can I can leave a little bit earlier, but I am generally nine to five, I'm also on call Wednesday through Wednesday morning through Friday morning. and some Fridays and some weekends. So I'm nine to five plus, kind of when things come up that are unexpected. Yeah.

Interviewer  21:04  
And I'd imagine you know, we're all connected to our phones a lot, is it hard to have boundaries for you, like when you're, we know when you're not working to not pick up the phone? Or is it part of the job where you kind of need to be available at all times. It's

Emma Spiller  21:19  
it can, it can be both honestly, um, so I do have a, I have a separate work phone, which is helpful, just in terms of like, having something physically, I can sit down versus like my personal normal phone. So that's helpful. And I can kind of put that away or not look at that, when I really am feeling like I need a break. But our our direct care staff who are who I am their direct supervisor, they are dealing with things constantly. 

Emma Spiller  21:47  
So I do try to be as available as possible to them. Especially if I know that things like one kid has been having a particularly rough time or hidden like harder things are coming up, I do try to be more available. Because are the direct care staff are working like 12 to 14 hours, they're working longer shifts. So they're there for longer amounts of time that I am straight. And that can be really, really draining and hard. So I do try to be as available to them as as I feel like I can be within my capacity. Yeah.

Interviewer  22:21  
Okay. And you've been at Haven of Hope for 10 years, you want to share with us, maybe one of your favorite projects that you've worked on or or maybe even currently working on. Yeah,

Emma Spiller  22:32  
and, um, there was like a, there was a big reform in the foster care system if several years ago. And there used to be group homes for foster youth with like levels of kind of acuity. And a few years ago, they there was a big shift in, in that system. And so we had to shift from being a group home to what's called a short term residential therapeutic program. And so that was a really big endeavor, because especially because we're a smaller agency, so we had to completely rewrite our program, we had to redo we're a completely different program than we were when I started. And so that was really hard to do initially. But is in the long run been really beneficial. 

Emma Spiller  23:23  
We have a full clinical team and staff now, which we didn't when I started. And we've kind of been we try to adapt the program, to different things that come up, because working with teenagers, they there's different things that are kind of different patterns that come up and different things we had to deal with. And so we're kind of constantly adapting our program to work for the kids and be in the best interest of the kids. So I think, I don't know if that quite answer your question.

Interviewer  23:54  
Yeah. No, it does. Yeah, I think that's great. You know, talking about individual differences and you know, adopting different care to fit that person, yeah, that's great. In, you've kind of talked about it, but you know, what kind of person do you think would enjoy this? This line of work?

Emma Spiller  24:10  
Yeah, someone I mean, someone who's interested in the mental health field and someone who really just likes working with kids. It definitely takes a certain kind of resilient personality to work in residential care, especially with teenagers. Teenagers can be really challenging. And sometimes, kids, especially the residents that we work with, they've been through a lot and oftentimes that can when they're frustrated or upset that can come off directed at people and that can be really hard for people who who are just kind of adjusting to this kind of field. 

Emma Spiller  24:53  
So honestly, someone who's who's pretty resilient and I'm someone who is open to feedback. both from Kids and from other people that are working with AI we do work as a tight knit team. And being open to feedback from from your peers and for your managers I'm open to I try to ask the staff like how if I'm doing things right, or I'm handling things the best way because different kids need different approaches and different people have different skills. So someone who's like really open to feedback is really helpful and in open to changing things they're doing. Because sometimes the way you do things with one kid doesn't work at all for the next kid.

Interviewer  25:37  
Yes. Did you have a mentor you know, throughout your career or in life that you first to bounce things off of? Or you had questions about career or whatever that you found helpful? Yeah,

Emma Spiller  25:51  
It's hard to pick one, I don't have like a specific mentor person that comes to mind. Outside of like, so our director at human of hope her name is Davina she's founded, even if hope 25 years ago, this is actually our 25th anniversary year. 

Interviewer  26:09  
Congratulations. 

Emma Spiller  26:11  
And she's always been a really consistent person and really open to developing helpful and like developing my skills. And there again, kind of like our management team. Our other one of our other administrative person, people at the house has been was the program manager of our other house a while ago, and we've kind of also developed skills together. I think a lot of I think Haven of Hope, as an agency has developed a lot of who I am in over the last 10 years.

Interviewer  26:46  
 Oh, that's awesome. And, Emma, do you have any advice or resources for anyone listening that might be interested in pursuing this kind of career or line of work? 

Emma Spiller  26:56  
Yeah, I mean, I think honestly, like, it depends on if it's like haven of host specific or just working with foster youth. In general, I think working with foster youth has a lot of rewards. But also, I think, I guess this isn't really a resource, but just kind of a way of thinking is that they're still normal kids, and they need to be treated like normal kids that comes up with people who want to come in neck thinking, sometimes, like, save the kids or like, cure them from these high risk behaviors that we get people who come in, in and out who have that mentality. And that's really not in their best interest. 

Emma Spiller  27:35  
They're just kids and they need caring, compassion and support. Different resources, I think in the community that your future is our business is a great organization. And I think there's so many great, different and great resources for foster youth in Santa Cruz County, I think more I work with counties all over the state. And honestly, Santa Cruz County has so many more resources that a lot of other counties. So if people are looking for something specific, I don't know if I can, if they can reach out to you or in pass that on to me, but I'm happy to happy to talk to anyone who's interested in this as a career or answer any other specific questions. Yeah, outside of this time.

Interviewer  28:18  
Thank you very much in just real quick, do you have any advice for someone who may be unsure about their career path?

Emma Spiller  28:25  
Yeah, I think like getting figuring out who isn't, which is hard to do. But like figuring out who you are, what you value. And what things interest you. I, I don't have a typical office job. And I don't think I would really be super successful in a typical office job. And so figuring out what kind of like environment works for you, what kind of things like make your brain work, and just learning those different things about yourself. And I think working lots of different jobs to figure out those things is also really helpful. Awesome.
