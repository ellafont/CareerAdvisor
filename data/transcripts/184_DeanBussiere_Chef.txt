Dean Bussiere  0:59  
Hi, how you doing? 

Interviewer  1:00  
pretty good. Thank you very much for coming down to the station and being a part of our show. I really appreciate you taking your time. 

Dean Bussiere  1:05  
Well, thanks for having me on. 

#CAREER JOURNEY

Interviewer  1:07  
Dean, you've done a lot of cool stuff with your chef career. Would you please describe your career journey for us?

Dean Bussiere  1:14  
I grew up in a big family. We were a Brady Bunch and I had five sisters and three brothers. Both my parents worked. So I started cooking as a kid just to feed myself. And my first job was at the local dairy bar. I started as a dishwasher prep cook and really loved it worked my way up quickly. I was a line cook within two years and eventually learned everything there was in that business and then moved on and ended up in school for aeronautical engineering at UConn, but I was putting myself through school, cooking, and realized I didn't want to be an engineer. I preferred to be on my feet and the creativity that Culinary Arts allowed me was much more satisfying. So I dropped out and went to resort Yacht Harbor down in Florida, off of the keys and did two years down there and got into the Culinary Institute of America finally went up to Hyde Park, New York and was working my way through school and was able to graduate with an associate's degree within two years and debt free, because I worked the whole time and paid in advance for my classes. So that was a very smart move on my part. I didn't realize it at the time responsible, but never looked back. I came to the west coast to work at the Ahwahnee hotel when I graduated and was up in Yosemite National Park for six years. Ended up as executive chef at the Wawona hotel. And that's where I met my wife, Wendy, and we moved down here in 2000. And now have three boys and beautiful home here in Santa Cruz and just love it.

Interviewer  3:21  
That's awesome. Dean, thank you for sharing your awesome journey with us. Are you from the East Coast?

Dean Bussiere  3:26  
Yeah, born in Connecticut. 

Interviewer  3:28  
And you've been out here for 23 years how you loving living out here? 

Dean Bussiere  3:32  
Not going back.

Interviewer  3:36  
How was your time in New York at the Culinary Institute?

Dean Bussiere  3:39  
It was real hard. eight hour work days and eight hour class days. I was lucky to sleep six hours and I was working on the weekends as well. I did get some time to do some bike riding through the Vanderbilt and Roosevelt mansions that mid Hudson area really beautiful area, but I was mostly working and sleeping when I could. 

Interviewer  4:03  
Were you able to find a job like cooking kind of related to school? 

Dean Bussiere  4:06  
Yeah, well, I worked at the Ramada Inn right down the road from the school and on the weekends, I worked in New Paltz at a resort there. 

Interviewer  4:16  
So yeah, busy times. 

Dean Bussiere  4:18  
NonStop. 

#WORK LIFE BALANCE

Interviewer  4:19  
Awesome. Well, we were talking before the show about our shared passion of bike riding and what a great form of self care.

Dean Bussiere  4:25  
Yeah, it really helps with work life balance, to be able to get out and take care of yourself. It's easy to become quite heavy as a chef I might add to so you have to stay fit and active if you're going to make it the long term.

Interviewer  4:42  
And I mean working out the wanting must have been pretty magical time. 

Dean Bussiere  4:45  
Yeah, ultimate base camp where I was climbing and hiking every weekend. I've been on over 50 peaks in the park and it's just cool, magical experience.

Interviewer  4:57  
Do you make it out to Yosemite much these days 

Dean Bussiere  5:00  
All the time, every year we're up there.

Interviewer  5:02  
I would imagine it's gonna be a cool spring with all the.. 

Dean Bussiere  5:04  
Wild flowers are gonna be going off soon. 

Interviewer  5:07  
I want to go. Very cool. Well, thanks for sharing that and what's your I know you're kind of doing something different with your career, because you wanted to work more of a nine to five job, right?

Dean Bussiere  5:18  
Well, yeah, that's uh, so most of the time, the first 20 years of my life as I was speaking, I was working so much, and a lot of it came down to, you know, the high end, private restaurants and hotel jobs. It was 12 to midnight, and those long hours and late nights. So when we had our third kid, my wife was like, Hey, you gotta get a day job. And just at that same time, I was executive chef at the shadowbrook restaurant here in town and Dominican hospital put up an ad for a chef to run their department for the first time. And so I interviewed for that and ended up getting the position and spent eight years there. And then I went into long term care over the hill. And then I took my current position with Morrison healthcare. 

#DAY IN THE LIFE

Interviewer  6:15  
Do you want to talk about what it looks like for you, like kind of, I guess average, or typical, if there is, daily or week looks like for your current job. 

Dean Bussiere  6:25  
I currently now travel to many hospitals in the area. And I support and train executive chefs to run acute care hospital food service. And I also audit them for food safety and regulatory compliance. So it's a lot of education and just hands on, being observant and pointing out where things can be improved, and just help the team along the way to be in the best they can be.

Interviewer  7:00  
And would you say that? I mean, I think like the stereotype maybe people have with food that's provided at those plates maybe isn't great, but I would imagine it's gotten a really good lately. We were talking before the show that we kind of share this, you know, food as medicine. 

Dean Bussiere  7:16  
Yeah, the way I see it, I spent the first 20 years of my career killing people with my food, all the cream and butter and foie gras and stuff. Yeah. And the next 20 years I've been healing them. But it's a new world for hospital cuisine. It's a much, much fresher. We're using local and organic whenever possible. We have chefs running the kitchens, we're trying to convince hospital administration to go to room service style menus. A lot of it comes down to budget, but we can do a lot with what we have. And some really great chefs out there and inspiring me that the there's a lot for the future when it comes to health care food service. Improvements have been dramatic.

Interviewer  8:05  
I'd imagine. Well, because of you in part too.

Dean Bussiere  8:10  
I hope so. That's my ultimate job is to inspire others to aspire to be the best they can when it comes to the food that they put on the plate. And the decisions they make when buying that food are really important. Like, I'm a big proponent for local, organic and sustainably sourced food. And I'm now working myself into a position with Morrison healthcare, where I can drive that purchasing dollar decision to those organic and local and sustainable sources. 

Interviewer  8:51  
There's definitely a lot of good farms in the area and in a lot of places around the country that it's great to support them and provide that good food to people who could really use it. 

Dean Bussiere  9:00  
Amen. 

Interviewer  9:01  
Yeah, absolutely. And I think the other thing too, is like, people who maybe are in the hospital going through something if they start eating healthier in the hospital, they might see the benefit of eating healthy and maybe they won't come back to the hospitals.

Dean Bussiere  9:15  
Right. Yeah, well, so population health Management is a big buzzword now with all of the administration of hospitals and population health management is key to them getting reimbursement from the government as well. So we're helping them along that journey. You know, it goes beyond do no harm. We want to heal and inspire the people we serve and work with in the kitchens. 

Interviewer  9:43  
Yeah, like keep inflammation down and all kinds of other benefits, right? 

Dean Bussiere  9:46  
Yes, using spices instead of fats and salts. We're looking at you know, vegetable extracts and lemon and orange zest, herbs, fresh herbs.

Interviewer  9:59  
And there's good kinds of fats, right?

Dean Bussiere  10:03  
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I don't want to belittle that. And you know, even a low salt diet, there's a lot of controversy around that even being helpful for cardiac issues, unless you have hypertension. But there's so much it's so exciting to be in this field right now, with all they're discovering around gut biome, and just the relationship it plays with our immune system and our health in a lot of ways.

Interviewer  10:34  
And I was amazed to hear that most of our serotonin actually generated in our gut, not in our brain. 

Dean Bussiere  10:39  
It's amazing, though, what they're discovering. Every day, something new.

#WORK ENVIRONMENT

Interviewer  10:43  
And you kind of shared what your work looks like now. And I just was gonna ask kind of some of the environments that you work in, it seems like traveling is part of your job now.

Dean Bussiere  10:52  
Oh, gosh, let's talk COVID. I mean, there are 16 of my position in the country, corporate executive chefs overseeing food service at 900 hospitals. And we were being flown into surges to provide emergency food services, in tents in parking lots. And so it was very stressful time we were all vaccinated and boosted and all of that good stuff, but still people getting sick. 

Interviewer  11:27  
Well, thank you for doing all you can to help support. I can imagine that must have been very stressful for you and your family.

Dean Bussiere  11:36  
Yeah, when I would get back, I would test immediately before I would go sit with them and stuff. So it was hard.

Interviewer  11:44  
Yeah. But things are improving out there, I think. Right? 

Dean Bussiere  11:48  
They sure are. 

Interviewer  11:48  
Yeah, that's good. And did you develop any self care practices? You know, when things were super stressful like that? 

Dean Bussiere  11:57  
Good question. I mean, I did start looking at Wim Hof. And yogic breathing and meditation have always been big on my list of self healing. So I started doing that more.

Interviewer  12:13  
Yeah, good. I mean, breathing is huge. 

Dean Bussiere  12:15  
Yep. Just deep breathing. 

#SKILL DEVELOPMENT

Interviewer  12:17  
The box breathing. The four, seven, eight. Very cool. Do you want to share with us some of you know the skills that you use in your career? And how might you have developed these skills?

Dean Bussiere  12:28  
Well, I gotta say one of the most important skills I developed starting on was working in high volume kitchens, knife skills, because those knife skills have helped me impress others enough that they look up to me for advice and guidance. So it promoted me a sense into the chef position. All I really wanted to do is cook great food. But all my co workers would be like, well, you should be the chef. So as the rest of them stepped back, I was the one standing on the line. And I got into being the executive chef, just through hard work and having the skills that they wanted. So I started to learn communication. That was the big thing.

Interviewer  13:23  
Yeah. And, you shared with us earlier that you grew up in a big family, and you started cooking, kind of out of necessity you said, so you could eat. Did you enjoy cooking when you were younger? And did you start to think maybe, throughout schooling, maybe when you were studying to be an engineer like hey maybe cooking is more my passion? 

Dean Bussiere  13:43  
Yeah. I always kept falling back on it. And that was the reason that made me connect with, I always had that feeling. But I was going a path that I thought my parents wanted, and when I got in touch with myself, that's when I said, Hey, I'm going to be a chef. 

Interviewer  14:04  
That tends to happen, doesn't it? Right.

Dean Bussiere  14:08  
Yeah. And, the kids out there, you can make a career choice now. But it's never too late to change it. As you're going along your path and discovering your passions. It's important to listen to your intuition and follow those.

Interviewer  14:28  
And changing careers isn't necessarily negative either. I mean, that could just be another journey, another learning experience.

Dean Bussiere  14:36  
Yeah, maybe our parents worked for the same people for 40 years. And what did it get them? But it depends if you find a group of people that you enjoy being with and you're doing a job you enjoy doing. I could stay with it my life. 

#MENTORSHIP

Interviewer  14:37  
That's awesome. Thanks for sharing that Dean. For those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the What to be show on KSQD Santa Cruz 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart. And I'm speaking with Chef Dean Bussiere. Dean, I want to ask you throughout your career, did you have mentors that you could bounce things off of? And maybe when you have questions?

Dean Bussiere  15:16  
Yeah, most of the private restaurants where I worked, there was always a great chef at the helm. Emil Moser was a great inspiration for me. When I worked at a Emil's restaurant cooking school in San Jose, and we took the Zagat 27, number one French restaurant in the Bay Area when I was there. 

Interviewer  15:42  
Congratulations. 

Dean Bussiere  15:43  
Thanks. So I learned a lot. And now it's people like Jose Andre, at the world central kitchen. He's out there, helping in Ukraine feed the starving people who have no power and no water. Just inspirational to see that kind of community effort and leadership on his part. And I think all chefs have a obligation because of their buying power to support that kind of business.

Interviewer  16:23  
It seems like that's important to you, too. 

Dean Bussiere  16:26  
Yeah, I'm big into making sure that the planet is here for our children. And right now, food service has a larger impact on greenhouse gas and global warming than all of the transportation industry. A lot of it has to do with dairy farms and cattle. But, we do have regenerative agriculture within our grasp. And if more of us are looking to be plant forward in our diet, it's going to help hugely reverse the negative impacts we've had. 

Interviewer  17:07  
thanks for sharing. And, you know, I can't help but think about our local agriculture here and all the destruction because of the storms. Right? And I wonder if that's going to really impact all that food that's getting sourced to a lot of the restaurants in places like Dominican did you have a garden there when you were there. Do you wanna share?

Dean Bussiere  17:25  
Yeah, we did have a donation from one of our benefactors. And they set up an organic garden on site. And they continue to produce vegetables and some great stuff right there, the herbs and everything. And it's nice. Eventually, they hope to be able to get patients out there and use it as part of a rehabilitation program. I don't know if that's going to be possible. But it's exciting.

Interviewer  18:00  
I love that idea to if, if possible, for people to get out there and contribute. 

Dean Bussiere  18:05  
We have rooftop gardens on some hospitals in the country now. There's a huge one in Boston, and the hospitals actually donating most of that produce to the needy in the city. 

Interviewer  18:17  
Love to hear it. And I want to ask you, do you make it into a kitchen much these days? 

Dean Bussiere  18:25  
Oh yeah. Well, the new position I'm working into, will be home based. But the day to day job was visiting a different kitchen every day and assessing what's going on and helping the chef correct any issues that I might see. 

Interviewer  18:46  
But you're more like, overseeing, I guess. 

Dean Bussiere  18:48  
Yeah. As a corporate chef, I'm there to support train, guide, teach, and protect. And hopefully inspire the frontline associates, the cooks that are there to one day become chefs and teach them a few things about getting there. 

Interviewer  19:07  
It seems like you have a lot of knowledge and wisdom to share with people coming up entire careers.

Dean Bussiere  19:13  
I hope. Communication is the hardest part of being an executive chef. As a cook, you got to learn the skills and build your taste palette, start tasting everything you're making along the way the herbs, you're using all the individual components, and then how they come together and build that tastes memory. But then as you develop into an executive chef role, it's more people skills and communication. And the words we use are so important, but 90% of communication is nonverbal. So it's how and when you use those words that can either inspire someone or you caused them to clam up.

#LEARNING CURVE

Interviewer  20:02  
And as you kind of moved up in your career and you started taking on maybe bigger roles was there kind of a big learning curve for you, as far the communication part of the work side of it? 

Dean Bussiere  20:14  
Of course. And, but that's the one of the beauties. And the things I like about Culinary Arts is it's always evolving and changing. And you could even specialize in one cuisine your entire life, and still not be an expert in it. But being an executive chef, you have to be a jack of all trades. And you have to know pastry chef, you have to know baking, and you have to know the saute, broil, braise, grill, and you have to be able to do it as well as any of your employees so that you can get them to be better at what they're doing.

Interviewer  20:52  
I have to ask now, because of your professional work, when there's a barbecue or when there's a get together, are the eyeballs on you?

Dean Bussiere  21:04  
I'm always doing something for family and friends. And yeah, my wife's mom was immediately in love with me when I did Christmas dinner. So it has helped me in my personal life. And people enjoy a good meal. So it's a great skill to have.

Interviewer  21:23  
And cooking good food and getting people together. When you're eating good, healthy food. I mean, what a beautiful thing. Right?

Dean Bussiere  21:28  
Right, bringing people together around the table and in the kitchen. You know, what can be more communal? And there's always opinions about food. And something else I learned as an executive chef, you have to have a heart of gold and alligator skin. Because what one person loves another won't, you know, and I have a great story of, I ran a new special at the senior living facility I was working at. And I was walking through the halls one day and one guest stopped me and said, Hey, that such and such you we had for dinner was so good, you should do that more often. I went around the corner. And another guest stopped me and said, Oh, that special last night was horrible. Don't do that again.

Interviewer  22:21  
I could see how it could be hard sometimes perhaps to not take it personally, when you've invested like your heart and soul into this. 

Dean Bussiere  22:29  
And you learn along the way, you're not cooking for yourself, you're cooking for your guests. And that's one of the main things we've seen change in the industry. Now, it's data driven. And I travel with a laptop now instead of my knife kit. And although I'm often picking up a knife to show someone a skill, or whatever it is, it's more computer based and looking at data and driving results.

#ADVICE FOR INTERESTED LISTENERS

Interviewer  23:03  
Okay, do you want to share with us what kind of people listening that are interested in pursuing this career do you think would enjoy this line of work?

Dean Bussiere  23:13  
Well, if you have a passion for cooking and creativity, you need that, that at the same time, you have to have some drive. It does when you're starting out, take a lot of hard labor, I mean, working the broiler at shadowbrook Restaurant on a busy Friday night, you're pumping out 200 steaks, and everyone has to be perfect because if one gets sent back, it throws you in the weeds. I love that term. But so it's very demanding. You have to have a lot of organizational skills so that everything is always in its place and where you expect it to be. So you can complete your tasks quickly. 

Interviewer  24:04  
And just trying to keep a cool head. 

Dean Bussiere  24:09  
And I guess I've always had that going for me being from a big family. That kind of helped. I grew up on a farm too. So I have a lot of respect for the ingredients. And we need that not just for the vegetable but how it was produced, who harvested it, were they paid well, are they treated fairly? Transportation? How did it get to me? How far did it have to come? There's so much to think about when it comes to sourcing the ingredients. But it's one huge dynamic job and it's exciting and it's demanding and it's satisfying. 

Interviewer  24:55  
Awesome. Dean, what kind of advice or resources can you provide to students or anyone listening, who might be interested in pursuing this line of work?

Dean Bussiere  25:03  
Well, I gotta say, going and getting my associates degree accelerated my career, it wasn't necessary. If I had continued to cook hard and do well, I probably would have still ended up as an executive chef. But not as quickly. I was an executive chef, by the time I was 24. And my having that degree really helped me. Then I also joined the American Culinary Federation, and started building a circle of friendship, influence, whatever you want to say. And so it's important to never burn bridges. Always, if you do leave a job, give notice and do it gracefully. And, gosh, interviewing is important. start documenting your achievements. With specifics and photos help. I eventually built up a huge curriculum vitae, and I have videos of my television time and Bon Appetit Magazine published one of my recipes. So I have that in the files. Keep a portfolio. 

Interviewer  25:04  
great advice. Thanks for sharing that. And what about advice for someone who maybe is unsure about their career path?

Dean Bussiere  26:35  
Well, that's the listening. Well try a lot of different stuff. And maybe go to a counselor and take one of the aptitude tests, what could you be good at? And then think about if I'm good at these sort of things, math has helped me hugely in my current role, believe it or not, there's a lot of numbers that go into being a successful restaurant owner. So just be a sponge, and be aware and listen and observe a lot. And part of that listening is getting in touch with yourself and finding out what makes you happy. 

#CONCLUSION

Interviewer  27:22  
Thank you so much for sharing that. And is there anything you're planning for the future? Have you ever considered maybe opening a restaurant in town?

Dean Bussiere  27:30  
I considered that but that's not in my future. I'm very happy where I'm at now, as a corporate chef, I'm making over six figures. And it's what I need, and I don't want to risk losing all that I have by opening up a restaurant. Yeah. But, I thought about it. And I almost did it a couple times along my career path, but it was never in the cards.

Interviewer  27:58  
Okay. Well, Dean, congratulations on your wonderful career. And thank you so much for sharing your inspiring story with us today. I really appreciate you taking the time.

Dean Bussiere  28:05  
Thank you so much for having me on and to you know, anybody out there. Healthcare is a great place you don't think about being a chef in a health care facility, but it's offers you a good work life balance because of the day time rather than all the nights and weekends and holidays. You know, you can be home on the weekends.

Interviewer  28:29
