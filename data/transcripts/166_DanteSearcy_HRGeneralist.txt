# INTRODUCTION
Interviewer  0:16  
Hello and welcome everyone to KSQD Santa Cruz at 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart and you're listening to our show What To Be, where we interview inspiring people and highlight their careers. What To Be is a program provided by Your Future Is Our Business, a Santa Cruz County nonprofit that helps students explore careers through programs such as college and career expos, panels and other work based learning activities. 


Please note that the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily represent or reflect those of Natural Bridges media, or Your Future Is Our Business. The information provided during this program does not reflect its career in its entirety. Today, I have the pleasure to speak to Dante Searcy, who's a Human Resources generalist at Joby Aviation, and is a attorney in training. Hi, Dante. 


Dante Searcy  1:05
Hi, Patrick. 


Interviewer  1:06
Thanks so much for coming down and being a guest on the show tonight. I really appreciate your help helping us out.


Dante Searcy  1:10  
All right. Thank you for having me. Patrick.


# CAREER JOURNEY
Interviewer  1:12  
Right on. You're welcome. Dante, you've done a lot of great stuff in your career. Would you please describe your career journey?


Dante Searcy  1:18  
Sure. I can talk a little bit about that. A good starting point will be my time in the US Navy. So I served in the US Navy from 2008 to 2013 as a Farsi translator. My first job when I got out of the Navy was working for manpower, which was a staffing agency located here in Capitola. I was working as a staffing specialist. That was the first time I realized that you could do human resources as a career. After about a year there, I took a position at Santa Cruz County working in their personnel department as a recruiter, and was there for a few years. 


During this time, I really wanted to get into tech, but my skill set wasn't necessarily techie. I didn't necessarily have any specialized training in engineering or computers, but when I was doing a job search, I saw an opportunity with Joby Aviation, as a human resources generalist; went ahead and applied for that position. That was back in February 2020, and I've been at Joby ever since


Interviewer  2:19  
Right on. Yeah. That sounds like a very exciting company to work for.


Dante Searcy  2:22  
Yes. It's really exciting.


Interviewer  2:25  
A lot of cool stuff coming out. And I think you shared with me before that. You guys went public last year?


Dante Searcy  2:31  
Yes. It was back in August of 2021. We went public.


Interviewer  2:37  
Very cool. Going back to your time in the Navy, thank you for your service, where were you from? Did you come to Monterey to go to the language institute in Monterey?


Dante Searcy  2:46  
I'm actually originally from Sacramento, California. It was interesting because I joined the Navy thinking I was going to travel the world and be all on boats and see lots of different ports and everything, but the job I ended up doing landed me in Monterey, which was only about three hours away from home in Sacramento. 


I was stationed in Monterey, where I went to the Defense Language Institute and studied Persian Farsi. There. From there I [was] stationed at Fort Gordon in Augusta, Georgia, and I was stationed there for about five years.


Interviewer  3:19  
Okay. And I can imagine that learning Farsi probably took some time, like [it’s a] difficult and beautiful language, right? 


Dante Searcy  3:27  
Yes, it's a very beautiful language. I really enjoyed learning it. It was definitely difficult, but the way they have it set up in the way of the military tradespeople. They have really effective training there. We were in class from about 8am, to about 3:30pm. So when you're learning it all day every day. All of our instructors that we had were native from Iran. We had all native teachers that were there teaching us the language, so they have a really effective way of making sure that people are able to learn the language and be able to serve effectively as translators.


Interviewer  4:06  
Okay. Did you enjoy your time? You know, in the service overall?


Dante Searcy  4:10  
Yes, I definitely did. I mean, there's definitely some some difficult parts about being in the military. You're away from your family at times. It can be unpredictable at times. But for the most part, you've got the camaraderie because you're there with people and you're all there for a common mission; especially in the job that I was doing. It was a really small team of people that were that were working as linguists and as translators, so you get really close with the people that you're serving with. And yeah, we had a good time.


Interviewer  4:45  
Okay. Did that job in the military take you overseas?


Dante Searcy  4:50  
Not me in particular, and it's all depending on what's going on in the in the global climate at the time. A lot of people that I was serving with during 2008 to 2013, who were speaking Arabic or who had studied Arabic, had the opportunity to go overseas. But a lot of our a lot of our center of intelligence was based out of Fort Gordon, so there were a lot of us that stayed stateside.


Interviewer  5:17  
Okay. Yeah. And being stationed in Monterey. That's pretty awesome. I mean, super beautiful place.


Dante Searcy  5:21  
It's a really nice place to be stationed. Yes.


# HOW PREVIOUS EXPEREINCES HAVE HELPED
Interviewer  5:24  
Very cool. And do you think that maybe that lifestyle benefited you going forward and different[ly], like your career? Maybe that structure? 


Dante Searcy  5:33  
Oh, absolutely. I mean I learned a lot of discipline. I would say it gave me discipline, it gave me structure. It gave me a lot of the skill sets that I gained from the military, definitely things that I use today: showing up on time to places, basic things, attention to detail, teamwork, and working with different people. 


When you're there, you are thrown into a group where you've got people from all over the country. So you've got people that have different political views, different races, different religions, and everything like that. But you're all together sort of leveled out, because you're all the same. So it really taught me teamwork. I really say now, when I go into work environments, I can literally work with anybody, because I've worked with with everybody. Yeah. And so there's a lot of really good skills that I gained from that time.


Interviewer  6:30  
Yeah, and focusing on maybe the common goal, or that we're all in this together type of thing, and then focusing maybe on differences. I can imagine that would help and probably like working in HR.


Dante Searcy  6:41  
Absolutely. During that time, you know, how you mentioned learning Farsi or learning a foreign language in a short period of time sounds like it's difficult. It showed me what I was capable of doing. When you are placed in certain situations, and you're like, “Oh, my God, that seems impossible,” and then you do it, then you're like, “oh, wow, I didn't know I had that in me. If I can do that, then what then what else can I do?” And I think I do carry that with me even now because I have that time where I was able to do things that I thought I couldn't do. Now I'm continuing to do thingsthat, at the beginning seems like I'm not able to do.


# LEGAL JOURNEY
Interviewer  7:22  
Well, like studying for your law degree. You told me that your second year, congrats on finishing the first year, starts tomorrow. 


Dante Searcy  7:29
That's tomorrow that school starts Yes. 


Interviewer  7:31
Super exciting. And who knows? Like you said you've done things in your life to prove that you can do more, and this is like the next journey for you. It sounds like you're gonna be successful in whatever you try to do. 


Dante Searcy  7:42
I appreciate that. Thank you. 


Interviewer  7:44
Awesome. And you want to become an employment lawyer?


Dante Searcy  7:48  
Yes. So what gave me the idea to even go into the legal profession is actually connected back to Joby. We brought on a legal team, and I had the opportunity to work really closely with a lot of our attorneys at Joby. It was the first time I had worked so close[ly] with attorneys, and really saw what they were doing. I think before it seemed like the legal profession was really inaccessible. You had to have a lot of money and be really smart. It just seemed like something I wasn't cut out to do. 


When I was working closely and directly with a lot of the attorneys, I thought okay, maybe this is something I can do. Working in human resources, you are essentially, I would say, lawyers, in a sense, because we deal with a lot of legal issues with hiring people with different situations that come up in the workplace. So for me, it seems like a natural segway transition.


Interviewer  8:56  
Yeah. Well, I'm excited for you. And I was telling you before the show that I have a friend who's an intellectual property lawyer, and not knowing anything about it's so much more interesting than I could have thought; shout out rose, but very cool stuff. I'm excited for you on your next journey in that, and what's that mean for you? Like with Joby with your job there?


Dante Searcy  9:16  
Well, there's a lot of opportunities. I feel like being Joby or being in tech in general, seemed like a far off dream at one point. Now I'm here and I'm in it, so I always think about opportunities as being open. And so I don't really limit myself to what can be out there. I really love working a job and I love the mission that we are working on. So I hope that there will continue to be opportunities for me


# JOBY BACKGROUND
Interviewer  9:55  
And what's kind of the history of Joby? You told me a little bit before that started in a more or less a barn in Bonnie doon. Right? Do they still operate out of there? And then they did move into like the old CMX plant in Davenport. And I've also heard they have offices in Marina and maybe San Jose.


Dante Searcy  10:11  
Yes. So I am going to, so I'm going to put on my legal teams hat. Yeah, make sure that I'm sharing information that I can share. But yes, we do have various locations throughout California. We've got the location in Santa Cruz. On the west side, we've got a location in Marina, where we're building up our manufacturing facility, and then we've got our power train and electronics facility that's located in San Carlos.


Interviewer  10:41  
Okay. And how many employees are there at Joby currently? 


Dante Searcy  10:45  
That's proprietary information, so I'm not able to share that.


Interviewer  10:49  
Okay. But yeah, maybe they're growing quite a bit.


Dante Searcy  10:52  
But we are growing. Okay. Yeah, I could say that. Yes.


Interviewer  10:53  
Very cool. Yeah. And I have a friend who CNC parts there, and he doesn't really know a whole lot. He just knows what he knows, but he does enjoy working there.


Dante Searcy  11:03  
Yeah, everyone that works there is really passionate about the mission, and we're bringing new technology into aviation that hasn't been done before. It's interesting because working at Joby really reminds me of my time in the military in a lot of ways because we work hard. When you're in the military, you work really hard. You're in a situation where you're all working towards a common goal, so I see a lot of parallels. We actually have a lot of veterans out that work at Joby as well, so I think that environment is is fitting.


Interviewer  11:41  
Very cool. And if I might ask, who founded Joby? Did they have a background in aeronautics and aerospace?


Dante Searcy  11:49  
The current CEO of Joby is JoeBen Bevirt. He does have an engineering background, and has founded lots of companies throughout his throughout his career. This is his big dream: to be able to build an electric vertical takeoff aircraft. This is one of his main projects that he's been really wanting to get off the ground.


Interviewer  12:17  
Visiting the website briefly there’s very cool video that plays that shows the aircraft taking off and flying; that it is a vertical takeoff that definitely would help. I guess is this ideally going to be for commuters, for people to get to work? I mean, what's I wonder what the big long term goal is?


Dante Searcy  12:42  
So that's a that's a good question. So the main goal, we say our vision is to save a billion people an hour a day. That is basically looking at traffic. The time that you spend sitting sitting in traffic, the time that people spend commuting, especially people that live in big cities. I know for myself, even being from Sacramento, which at one point was not necessarily a big city, but even every time I go back, there's new freeways and new highways, there's more people. Our population is growing, we just have more people, so there's gonna be more cars and more traffic. 


The idea is to not continue to think of things in 2d but to think of things in 3d because we've got the airspace that we can utilize for transportation. The real mission, even wanting to save people time is really about the environment. That's the reason why we've got such a focus on making sure that the aircraft is electric because aviation does contribute to a lot of pollution that is happening because of all the all the fossil fuels. That is really our CEO and our company's mission is to bring new technology into the transportation airspace, but essentially to help out with transportation while also helping out the environment.


Interviewer  14:06  
Yeah, very cool. And how many people fit inside the aircraft? Are there different models?


Dante Searcy  14:10  
There are four people that can sit in it with the pilot, so technically five, but it's built to have four passengers.


Interviewer  14:19  
Okay. Yeah, I wonder like in the future, if it could be like a, something that you could like order like an Uber or something.


Dante Searcy  14:26  
That's essentially the way that we want to set up the vessel. Eventually the way we want to set up is you have the app and then if you want to book a trip for, let's say, from here to Sacramento, and part of that trip might include having an Uber come and pick you up and take you to one of the ports. When you book your trip [it] would incorporate all of that. It would incorporate the car that comes to get you to take you to the port. Then you take the Joby aircraft to your next location, and then there might be another car waiting for you there to get you to your final destination. 


Interviewer  15:07  
Yeah, very cool. Sounds very streamlined.


Dante Searcy  15:08  
Absolutely. That's the goal.


Interviewer  15:11  
Right on and that yeah, that kind of brought up another question I had what the range is currently?


Dante Searcy  15:17  
That is a good question. I believe it's 150 miles, I can hear the engineers' ears burning right now. They're like, “he's getting everything wrong. Oh, my God.” This is also where I play my card and say that I work in HR.


# MAIN JOB RESPONSIBILITIES
Interviewer  15:31  
That's totally fair. Yeah. [Do] You just want to briefly tell us a little bit about what your main duties and responsibilities are day to day at Joby?


Dante Searcy  15:39  
Absolutely. So as an HR generalist, it's pretty cool because I get to do lots of different things. My main responsibilities are helping out with onboarding our our new hires that are coming into the company. So I'd help out with our day one orientation, also help out with offboarding employees who are leaving the company going going on to other places. Essentially helping employees through their entire lifecycle while they're while they're at Joby. I also help with drafting Separation Agreements, I help with processing workers claims when employees get injured. I assist with our diversity and inclusion initiatives as well, and also help with managing our commercial insurance policy.


# PANDEMIC IMPACTS
Interviewer  16:19  
Okay. Did what was going on the past couple years affect production work? Are people able to work? I'd imagine some people are probably able to work remotely, right?


Dante Searcy  16:32  
Absolutely. That's a that's a really good question. So I started at Joby in February of 2020. So I started just like normal, just starting a new job. Then literally six weeks later, we're sending people home to work remotely. In human resources, we did have a lot of flexibility to work from home, but there are other parts of the company that had to continue to function and didn't really have that flexibility to work from home because you have to be on site to build an aircraft; literally, you have to be hands on. 


It gave me an entirely different perspective on human resources from what I had done in my previous careers because there's also the fires that happened during that time, too. In March, we sent people home and then the fires are happening maybe around May or June of that year. It's kind of all a blur. We were helping people get situated working from home because we had to get people equipment, we had to help people get their workstation situated. [For] people that were impacted by the fires, I was helping people book storage units for people that had been displaced and helping people find other places to stay. 


It made human resources human to me because I had to think about people, where they were living, where they were staying, their situations, and all that stuff. Something else that was a surprise to me at the time was having to pivot and be flexible because I was in charge of onboarding our new hires at the time. We sent people home on a Wednesday, but then we had a new group of new hires coming in that following Monday. I was like, how do we onboard people remotely? How do we do that? I have never done this before. I've no idea. We have this joke at Joby that we all find ourselves saying like, Oh, I have we've never done this before. I have no idea what I'm doing. Then we and we just roll with it and figure it out.


Interviewer  18:33  
Yeah, lots of learning. Absolutely. Yes. And that's what it's all about. Right? Very cool. But I can imagine it was definitely some added stress for you.


Dante Searcy  18:42  
Yes, I mean it was definitely stressful, but the one thing about being in Human Resources is that you have to almost put your stress to the side because if you're stressed then people can feel it. You also are empathizing with other people too, their situations, and what they're going through. Even outside of the pandemic or outside of the fires. Being in human resources, you are there when people have babies, you're there when people have family members die, you're there when people have any of their major life events; all your major life events you go to HR. So I think we as a skill set have a way of managing our own stress in our own way where we focus on wellness or self care, whatever we need to do to make sure that we can be a good resource for our employees.


Interviewer  19:44  
Yeah, I can imagine it may be difficult at time to create boundaries with employees when they're sharing super personal stuff.


Dante Searcy  19:54  
Yeah, I mean, you definitely need to have boundaries and understand that you're in a professional environment and know that you're there as a resource to help them. But I think also with boundaries, there is a fine line because there can also be times where you can be too detached from people. So you also want to have that human touch with people too. It's okay to be vulnerable, and to empathize with the person. For example, my father passed away in 2021, but I can empathize with people now, when they're coming in there say, “oh, I had a family member pass away, or I had I had a parent pass away.” I'll tell people about my situation. I still have boundaries, healthy boundaries and everything, but when it's appropriate, I can let my guard down and be vulnerable with the person too.


Interviewer  21:00  
Yeah. And that can help create space for trust, and that feels really good for people going through stuff.


Dante Searcy  21:07  
Yes, it does. Because when they're coming to you, even though we're at work, we're still human at the end of the day. Your family and life situations are still going to impact you even in even in a professional environment.


# WORK ENVIORNMENT
Interviewer  21:22  
Okay. And for those who are just tuning in, you're listening to the What to Be show on KSQD Santa Cruz, 90.7 FM. I'm Patrick Hart, and I'm speaking to Dante Searcy, who's a Human Resources generalist at Joby aviation, and is also an attorney in training. Dante, I wanted to ask you what kind of environments do you work in Joby? Are you in the office primarily? During the last couple of years, were you utilizing Zoom quite a bit for maybe some of your meetings?


Dante Searcy  21:50  
I work primarily in in office. Yeah, we're primarily in the office, and we've got some, like I mentioned earlier being on the Human Resources team, we do have some flexibility to work from home. It's interesting because I'm such an introvert. I thought that working from home that I would always want to work from home, but I really enjoyed being in office and being around people. So yes, I work primarily from from an office. And there was another question. Yes. And I don't remember the second one.


Interviewer  22:24  
No worries that like, if you were using Zoom?


Dante Searcy  22:27  
Oh, yes, we got really good with using Zoom. We actually use, we still use Zoom quite a bit, because we still have a lot of people that work remotely, even post pandemic. We've got people that are on teams that work remotely. Even a lot of people on our team work from different places, different locations. Dduring the pandemic, we use Zoom quite a bit.


# SKILLS AND JOB RESPONSIBILITIES
Interviewer  22:54  
Okay and do you want to share with us some of the skills you use in your job? Did you maybe acquire some of these skills in your other HR jobs or maybe some in the military?


Dante Searcy  23:02  
Yes. So I would say a lot of people skills, and I know that sounds cliche, because it's Human Resources, of course. If someone's interested in this position, and or this career, and you're good with people, you'd like to talk to people. Like I said, I call myself an introvert, but I'm also but I'm a people person, as well. If you just if you're a good listener, I think that's another really good skill set. There's a lot of soft skills that are necessary for human resources. The cool thing about it is that there's so many different fields you can get into. So if you're good with numbers, you can do payroll. If you're good with data and analytics, you can do talent development, and data analytics. If you like health and wellness, you can manage benefits programs, there's really a place for everybody in this career field


Interviewer  23:55  
At Joby, do you wear different hats? Like within HR or you focusing more on one particular area. 


Dante Searcy  24:02  
At the beginning when I first started and our team was a lot smaller we all wore lots of different hats. We might have had job titles, but we would definitely hop and have to do lots of different things. Now that our team is growing, especially post pandemic, we are able to specialize a little bit more and some of us that were wearing lots of different hats are starting to descope and able to specialize a little more.


Interviewer  24:25  
Yeah, but maybe that was kind of nice to to see areas that you like more than others.


Dante Searcy  24:29  
Absolutely. Yes. It definitely gave me an opportunity to see things I like, things I didn't like, and helps to specialize for sure.


# PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE JOB
Interviewer  24:39  
Okay. And you've worked in some different careers, I guess. Do you have any favorite projects that you've worked on or currently working on?


Dante Searcy  24:47  
It's interesting because I didn't enjoy it at the time, but I did enjoy revamping our onboarding process. I would say that was the one project that really carried us through through the pandemic was really figuring out on the fly. We have this process in place, and now we have to completely throw it away and revamp it because we've got this global pandemic that nobody planned for. I think that experience really helped me now approach different projects. I would say also, being able to analyze documents, look at look at laws look at look at different things that that come up in, in different work situations is also a really good skill.


Interviewer  25:36  
Thanks for sharing that. Did you have a misconception about what HR work looked like before you started in the field?


Dante Searcy  25:44  
Yes, I thought it was easy.


Interviewer  25:49  
Yes, Little did you know,


Dante Searcy  25:50  
Little did I know. Yeah, it's definitely not easy. It needs a lot of organizational skills, a lot of attention to detail. Again, I think what I've learned from doing HR at Joby is all of the different aspects of HR, that are required to make sure that our department is able to function.


# SELF CARE PRACTICES
Interviewer  26:15  
Okay. During the last couple of years or so, have you developed your own kind of self care practices that kind of help you bring that kind of ease maybe to the workplace.


Dante Searcy  26:27  
Absolutely. I recently, my co workers will laugh if they're listening to this, but I recently got an E-bike. And it's my favorite toy. It's amazing. I love it. That's mainly what I've been doing for self care, is making sure that, and I don't know how I don't know how cliche, this sounds, but just making sure I'm getting enough exercise and making sure I'm outside. Because we're so busy and there's so many things that need to get done, it's so easy to stay inside and stay on your laptop and not take that time to be outside and to keep yourself healthy. So that's the main thing I've been doing for self care recently.


Interviewer  27:07  
I'm with you on the bicycles. Amazing. They've gotten me through a lot in my life.


Dante Searcy  27:11  
Yeah, I mean, before my first year of law school, I was stress eating, but now I'm gonna stress bike. That's what I'm planning to do on for the second year.


# MENTORSHIP
Interviewer  27:22  
Nutrition is so important, right? Oh, yeah. Awesome. Did you have a mentor in your life that you could bounce stuff off of? That helped you?


Dante Searcy  27:30  
Well, that's a good question. It's interesting because I would say the first part, maybe during my 20s, and my 30s, I didn't really have a concept of asking for help or having mentors. So I think I made a lot of mistakes because I felt it was vulnerable or like a sign of weakness to ask for help. It's only been recently actually, when I got my interview at Joby and I was going to interview with Joby, I reached out to a mentor that was a family friend who had been doing in business for a lot of years. I said, “I'm so freaked out, I really want this position, but I've no idea what I'm getting myself into, like, this is my job that I really want.”, and she really coached me through the interview process and really said, “Okay, you should ask this, you should prepare for this, think about this.” 


Ever since then, I got a mentor when I was thinking about applying for law school, who's a former attorney that I've worked with at the county. For anyone listening, I would definitely say the, it is not a sign of weakness to ask for help. It's a sign of strength, I think, to reach out to people admit that you're vulnerable. Admit that you want that you need guidance.


Interviewer  28:37  
And not only do I think it's really really beneficial to us, but it makes the person you're asking for help feel really good to that you trust them in their opinion. It's like that whole ripple effect that can just keep going.


Dante Searcy  28:49  
Right? The one thing I've learned about working in HR is that people love to talk about themselves. When you're doing interviews, that's how you got me here today. So yeah, if you're, if you have a person that is doing a career that you want to learn more about, I really believe that everybody loves that opportunity to be able to pay it forward and talk about their journey and especially if it's going to help somebody.
